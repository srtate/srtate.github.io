Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are responsible for monitoring and
analyzing host or network activity to detect intrusions in order to
protect information from unauthorized access or manipulation. There
are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and
anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to
match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for
detecting known attacks. However, it cannot detect unknown attacks for
which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses
machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system
behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal
behavior. Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown
attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper,
we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious use
of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has
several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to
monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols
embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight monitoring process,
and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol
response directly.
