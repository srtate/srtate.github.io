A primary security challenge of the mobile agent paradigm is that of
protecting the data carried by a mobile agent. With the growing
popularity of e-commerce applications that use software agents, the
protection of mobile agent data has become imperative. To that end, we
evaluate the performance of four methods that protect the data
integrity of mobile agents. While some techniques have been proposed
in the literature, there has previously been no experimental study
comparing the various alternatives.  The set of integrity mechanisms
that we investigate includes existing approaches known as the Partial
Result Authentication Codes (PRACs), Hash Chaining, and Set
Authentication Code methods, as well as a technique of our own design,
which we refer to as the Modified Set Authentication Code method.  The
Modified Set Authentication Code method addresses several limitations
of the Set Authentication Code method. The performance experiments
were run using the DADS mobile agent system, for which we designed a
Data Integrity Module.  The experimental results showed that our
Modified Set Authentication Code technique performed comparably to the
Set Authentication Code method, showing some improvement in the
key generation times and agent size. In this paper, we compare the
trade-offs between security features and performance for all four
methods and identify the niche that each technique could fill.
