In this paper, we present the design of SAgent, a general-purpose
mobile agent security framework. SAgent is designed for comprehensive
protection of mobile agent computations and data in potentially
hostile environments and works with the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment)
platform, a FIPA-compliant multi-agent environment.  Using good
software engineering design techniques of software reusability and
abstraction, SAgent allows agent protection protocols and applications
to be developed independently of each other.  To accomplish this, a
clean conceptual framework is presented which encapsulates in several
general class interfaces the common security functionality required by
secure agent applications.  Since SAgent is designed to generically
protect the computations of mobile agent applications, we provide
implementations of two secure multiagent protocols that protect the
*confidentiality* of agent data as well as implementations of four
methods that protect the *integrity* of mobile agent
data. Experimental results showing the feasibility of these methods
are available in separate publications.  The goal of SAgent is to
provide a framework where proposed theoretical techniques can be used
and experimentally evaluated. SAgent allows a new security provider to
implement and experiment with new techniques for protecting mobile
agents in a well-defined manner and is generic enough to support both
software-based and hardware-based protections.
