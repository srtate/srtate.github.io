In this paper we describe a methodology for comparing the efficacy of openly-available natural deduction tutoring software for students. Our proposed evaluation metrics are objective and can be applied to systems during development, before student-based assessments are feasible. We apply our assessment to five natural deduction tutoring systems, including two currently under development, and report the results of these evaluations and comparisons.
