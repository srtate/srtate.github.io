Division is a fundamental problem for arithmetic and algebraic
computation.  This paper describes boolean circuits (of bounded
fan-in) for integer division (finding reciprocals) that have size
$O(M(n))$ and depth $O(\log n\log\log n)$, where $M(n)$ is the size
complexity of $O(\log n)$ depth integer multiplication circuits.
Currently, $M(n)$ is known to be $O(n\log n\log\log n)$, but any
improvement in this bound that preserves circuit depth will be
reflected by a similar improvement in the size complexity of our
division algorithm.  Previously, no one has been able to derive a
division circuit with size $O(n\log^c n)$ for any $c$, and
simultaneous depth less than $\Omega(\log^2 n)$.  Our circuits are
logspace uniform; that is, they can be constructed by a deterministic
Turing machine in space $O(\log n)$.

Our results match the best known depth bounds for logspace uniform
circuits, and are optimal in size.

The general method of high order iterative formulas is of independent
interest as a way of efficiently using parallel processors to solve
algebraic problems.  In particular, our algorithm implies that any
rational function can be evaluated in these complexity bounds.

As an introduction to high order iterative methods we also present a
circuit for finding polynomial reciprocals (where the coefficients
come from an arbitrary ring, and ring operations are unit cost in the
circuit) in size $O(PM(n))$ and depth $O(\log n \log\log n)$, where
$PM(n)$ is the size complexity of optimal depth polynomial
multiplication.
