In this paper, we consider a model of lossless image compression in
which each band of a multispectral image is coded using a prediction
function involving values from a previously coded band of the
compression, and examine how the ordering of the bands affects the
achievable compression. We present an efficient algorithm for
computing the optimal band ordering for a multispectral image. This
algorithm has time complexity $O(n^2)$ for an $n$-band image, while
the naive algorithm takes time $\Omega(n!)$. A slight variant of
the optimal ordering problem that is motivated by some practical
concerns is shown to be NP-hard, and hence, computationally
infeasible, in all cases except for the most trivial possibility. In
addition, we report on our experimental findings using the algorithms
designed in this paper applied to real multispectral satellite
data. The results show that the techniques described here hold great
promise for application to real-world compression needs.
