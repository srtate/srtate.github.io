We consider the problem of keeping sensitive data and algorithms
contained in a mobile agent from discovery and exploitation by a
malicious host.  The focus in this paper is on rigorous techniques
based on cryptographic protocols.  Algesheimer, Cachin,
Camenisch, and Karjoth (*IEEE Security and Privacy, 2001*) devised
a secure agent protocol in such a setting, where agents and hosts are
mutually distrusting, but access to a "trusted third party" is
available to all participants.  In this paper, we present ways of
removing the trusted third party, and achieving similar results
through the application of multiple agents.  As an agent on a remote
host is trusted by neither the current host nor the agent originator,
the remote agent cannot simply act as a "stand-in" for the trusted
third party, and requires the design of non-trivial multi-agent
protocols.  In addition, our multi-agent protocol can proceed if any
subset of the agents of a certain size is available at any particular
time, adding fault-tolerance which did not exist in previous
protocols, while achieving a high level of security.  Our solution
relies on well-tested cryptographic primitives, including threshold 
cryptography and oblivious transfer.
