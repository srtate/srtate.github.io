In this paper we examine problems motivated by on-line financial
problems and stochastic games.  In particular, we consider a sequence
of entirely arbitrary distinct values arriving in random order, and
must devise strategies for selecting low values followed by high
values in such a way as to maximize the expected gain in rank from low
values to high values.  We give optimal algorithms for this problem,
and provide tight analysis of their performance.
