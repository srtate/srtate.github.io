In this paper, we study the benefits and problems
associated with reordering the bands of a multispectral image for
performing lossless compression. Under a reasonable model of
inter-band prediction, we show how to efficiently compute the
optimal compression band ordering. In addition, we formalize the
restrictions that arise when bands need to be extracted individually
from a compressed archive, and show that computing the optimal
ordering under these restrictions is NP-hard, except in the most
simple case.
