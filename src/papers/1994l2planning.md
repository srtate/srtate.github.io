In this paper we address the issue of kinodynamic motion
planning. Given a point that moves with bounded acceleration and
velocity, we wish to find the time-optimal trajectory from a start
state to a goal state (a state consists of both a position and a
velocity). As finding exact optimal solutions to this problem seems
very hard, we present a provably good approximation algorithm using
the $L_2$ norm to bound acceleration and velocity. Our results are an
extension of the earlier work of Canny, Donald, Reif, and Xavier,
who present similar results where the dynamics bounds can be examined
in each dimension independently (they use the $L_\infty$ norm to bound
acceleration and velocity).
