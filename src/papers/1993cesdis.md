This is a report on a workshop that was organized in participation
with Jim Tilton of NASA, and publicized and assisted by the CESDIS
office at Goddard. This workshop was designed to enhance communication
between researchers in data and image compression, and the potential
users of data compression in the scientific community. The goals of
the workshop were twofold: education and collaboration.

The workshop hosted 10 presentations, with talks on data compression
by Tassos Markas, Jeff Vitter, Irving Linares, Edward Seller, and
Manohar Mareboyana, talks on scientific data use and collection by
Gene Feldman, Mary James, and Jim Pfaendtner, and related talks on
managing large amounts of scientific data by Kan Salem and Robert
Cromp. There were 58 registered attendees of the workshop, with
affiliations from industry, government, and academia.

The meeting was a productive one with contacts made between physical
scientists and compression researchers. Contacts were made with
Immanuel Freedman of the Cosmology Data. Analysis Center who was
interested in the vector quantization work developed by this
project. Contacts were also made with the various users of scientific
data who will supply test data for our compression projects. The
discussion period was useful in understanding the needs of the
scientific users, and was a motivation for the work in Iossless
compression of multispectral images described earlier in this report.
