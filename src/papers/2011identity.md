While women constitute 46.6 percent of the US workforce, only 20 percent of women hold Computer Science and Information Technology (CSIT) related jobs. In addition, although CSIT related job prospects are growing significantly according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is astounding to discover that fewer women are participating in this opportunity. The number of women majoring in computing related areas declined by 80% in the last decade and a 93% decrease since its peak in 1982. Identity-based theories in science and engineering show identity-related measures affect studentâ€™s education and career persistence. We propose an integrative approach to examine gender differences within the central notion of computer science and information technology (CSIT) identity formation by drawing upon social cognitive career theory, theory of planned behavior, and the theory of identity. Better understanding of identity issues could suggest interventions that would lead to more gender equity in the CSIT field.
