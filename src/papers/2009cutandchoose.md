At the heart of many fair exchange problems is verifiable escrow: a
sender encrypts some value using the public key of a trusted party
(called the recovery agent), and then must convince the receiver of
the ciphertext that the corresponding plaintext satisfies some
property (e.g., it contains the sender's signature on a
contract). Previous solutions to this problem are interactive, and
often rely on communication-intensive cut-and-choose zero-knowledge
proofs. In this paper, we provide a solution that uses generic trusted
hardware to create an efficient, non-interactive verifiable escrow
scheme. Our solution allows the protocol to use a set of recovery
agents with a threshold access structure, the \emph{verifiable group
escrow} notion which was informally introduced by Camenisch and
Damgard and which is formalized here.  Finally, this paper shows how
this new non-interactive verifiable escrow scheme can be used to
create an efficient optimistic protocol for fair exchange of
signatures.
