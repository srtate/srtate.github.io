In this paper, we show that the problem of computing the complex roots
of unity is not as simple as it seems at first.  In particular, the
formulas given in a standard programmer's reference book [Knuth,
*Seminumerical Algorithms*, 1981] are shown to be numerically
unstable, giving unacceptably large error for moderate sized
sequences.  We give alternative formulas, which we show to be superior
both by analysis and experiment.
