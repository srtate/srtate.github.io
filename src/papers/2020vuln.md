This paper reports on a careful study of vulnerabilities in open-source software, performing both a longitudinal study over 7 years of data and an in-depth exploration of a particular type of vulnerability. First, data was mined from Ubuntu security notices from 2012 to 2019, specifically pulling security notices published within the first year of each of the four stable releases during that time. This provided a dataset covering 3,232 security vulnerabilities, which were cross-referenced with other information, allowing us to identify trends in types of vulnerabilities over the past 7 years. Within these results, we see that out-of-bounds memory access (which includes the classic "buffer overflow" vulnerability) has consistently been the most pernicious security weakness, so in the second part of this research we performed an in-depth study of a random sample of 30 recent out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities. Beginning by evaluating each vulnerability in terms of seven features, we identified trends and patterns and expanded the analysis to a total of eleven features. These results help further understanding of how out-of-bounds access vulnerabilities occur in real software, which can help both researchers looking to improve tools for vulnerability analysis and developers learning how to avoid common pitfalls.
