Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental primitive used in many
cryptographic protocols, including general secure function evaluation
(SFE) protocols. However, interaction is a primary feature of any OT
protocol. In this paper, we show how to remove the interaction
requirement in an OT protocol when parties participating in the
protocol have access to slightly modified Trusted Platform Modules, as
defined by Sarmenta et al. in proposing the notion of count-limited
objects (clobs).  Specifically, we construct a new cryptographic
primitive called “generalized non-interactive oblivious transfer”
(GNIOT). While it is possible to perform GNIOT using clobs in a
straightforward manner, with multiple clobs, we show how to perform
this efficiently, by using a single clob regardless of the number of
values that need to be exchanged in an oblivious manner. Additionally,
we provide clear definitions and a formal proof of the security of our
construction. We apply this primitive to mobile agent applications and
outline a new secure agent protocol called the GTX protocol which
provides the same security guarantees as existing agent protocols
while removing the need for interaction, thus improving efficiency.
