In this paper we show how agent data integrity protections can be
provided in SAgent, which is a security framework designed for
comprehensive protection of mobile agents in JADE.  While SAgent was
designed for comprehensive security protocols with different design
and interaction criteria, we show how efficient integrity-only
protections can be seamlessly integrated into SAgent.  In situations
where the more challenging problem of working with secret data on
remote hosts is not needed, these integrity protection techniques
provide significantly better performance than the comprehensive
protections, as we demonstrate through a series of experiments.
