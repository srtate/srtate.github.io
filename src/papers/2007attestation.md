Direct anonymous attestation (DAA) is an anonymous authentication scheme adopted by the Trusted Computing Group in its specifications for trusted computing platforms. This paper presents an efficient construction that implements all anonymous authentication features specified in DAA, including authentication with total anonymity, authentication with variable anonymity, and rogue TPM tagging. The current DAA construction is mainly targeted for powerful devices such as personal computers, and their corresponding application areas, but is not entirely suitable for embedded devices with limited computing capabilities (e.g., cell phones or hand-held PDAs). We propose a new construction with more efficient sign and verify protocols, making it more attractive for embedded devices. We prove that the new construction is secure under the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.
