This paper presents SAgent, a general-purpose mobile agent security framework that is designed to protect the computations of mobile agent applications in potentially hostile environments. SAgent works with the JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment) platform, a FIPA-compliant multi-agent environment. SAgent supports modular and mostly orthogonal development of agent protection techniques and secure agent applications, so protocols and applications can be developed independently of each other. To accomplish this, a clean conceptual framework is presented which encapsulates in several general class interfaces the common security functionality required by secure agent applications. Furthermore, implementations are provided for two secure multi-agent protocols, and we give experimental results showing the feasibility of these protections. While a few other research projects have examined protocols and techniques for protecting agents, these have been theoretical explorations. SAgent's goal is to bring these theoretical techniques into practice so that they can be experimented with and used, in the framework of a design generic enough to support both software-based and hardware-based protections. The abstractions are clean, giving a well-defined way for a new security provider to implement and experiment with new techniques for protecting mobile agents.
