In this paper we present a new system for anonymous authentication,
which allows a user to prove possession of an authenticated credential
while not revealing his or her identity.  Our system is an extension
of an existing group signature scheme, providing additional features
drawn from work on traceable signatures and direct anonymous
attestation.  Our first extension, a property taken from traceable
signatures, allows a signer to later ``claim'' a signature,
proving that they are indeed the individual who created
this signature.  Our second extension, taken from the work on direct
anonymous attestation, allows a prover and verifier to agree on the
degree of linkability of transactions, ranging from completely
unlinkable transactions, to being able to link transactions made
within a fixed time period (like a day), to completely linkable
transactions.  Our scheme is efficient enough to be practical, and is
proved to be secure under the strong RSA assumption and the decisional
Diffie-Hellman assumption.
