When asymmetric cryptography techniques are used in wireless networks, the public keys of the nodes need to be widely available and signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). However, the existence of a single CA in large wireless networks such as mobile ad hoc networks and wireless sensor networks can lead the hotspot problem and become a security weakness. In this work, we propose a distributed technique to cache the public keys on regular nodes. Due to the limited memory size that each node is allowed to dedicate for key caching, only some keys can be cached. In our proposed technique, each node caches the public keys of a mix of local and remote nodes. Access to the public keys of other nodes is possible based on a chain of trust. Multiple copies of public keys from different chains of trusted nodes provide fault tolerance. We explain our technique in detail and investigate its salient features in this work. An interesting observation is the need to balance caching public keys of local nodes and remote nodes.
