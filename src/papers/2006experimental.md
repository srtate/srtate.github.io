In this paper we report results of experimental exploration of two
software methods for protecting the privacy and security of mobile
agents while they are operating on untrusted remote hosts.  The two
methods include a protocol due to Algesheimer, Cachin, Camenisch, and
Karjoth (the ACCK protocol) and a protocol due to Tate and Xu (the TX
protocol).  These protocol implementations are distributed as standard
"security providers" in our SAgent security framework, and this
paper examines the efficiency of these protocols and explores the
trade-off between security and efficiency that is achieved as the
different parameters are varied.  We believe this is the first
experimental testing of these powerful agent protection techniques,
and our experimental results show that for simple but useful
applications, these techniques provide strong and practical protection
for mobile agents.
