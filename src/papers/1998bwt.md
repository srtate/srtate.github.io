We show that the ordering used in the sorting stage of the
Burrows-Wheeler transform, an aspect hitherto ignored, can have a
significant impact on the size of the compressed data.  We present
experimental results showing smaller compressed output achieved with
two modifications to the sorting: using a better alphabet ordering and
reflecting the sorted strings as in binary reflected Gray coding.
