We propose an efficient authentication method for secure communication
among a set of devices that have a single trusted manager or
administrator, with protocols presented for authentication and
authenticated key exchange.  An example of such a setting would be a
set of devices or sensors owned by a single person, including
applications such as a smart house or coordinated control systems,
with emphasis on the simplicity and efficiency of the protocol. While
known techniques can solve this problem, we show how specific
properties of our setting can allow our more efficient solution, which
is more appropriate for embedded processors with limited computational
capabilities.  Specifically, a device using our protocol can
authenticate itself using only about 15% of the computation required
by a standard RSA signature-based authentication.  We prove that our
scheme is secure under the strong RSA assumption and the computational
Diffie-Hellman assumption.
