				<p>
					I have been working in computer science since the
					1980s, and am now semi-retired (still teaching occassionally).
					I have decades of experience and expertise
					in computer security, cryptography, and algorithm
					design and analysis, and I have published
					peer-reviewed research papers in top venues in all
					of these areas. I have also directed a significant
					amount of effort toward effective computer science
					education, with around 35 years of practical
					teaching experience and published papers.
				</p>
				<p>
					My most recent full-time faculty role was at UNC Greensboro, 
					where I joined in 2007 as the Founding
					Department Head for the <a
						href="https://compsci.uncg.edu"
						>Department of Computer Science</a
					>. At that time, the computer science programs (bachelor's and
					master's) were splitting from the former Department of
					Mathematical Sciences. I served as Department Head until
					2019, managing huge growth in the department, and led
					the creation of UNCG's Computer Science Ph.D. program. I retired 
					from UNCG in 2025, and taught a summer course at 
					the University of California at Berkeley (<a href="https://su25.eecs70.org/">CS70</a>)
					after that.
				</p><p>
					I earned bachelor's degrees in Computer Science, Electrical
					Engineering, and Mathematics from Vanderbilt University in 1986,
					and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Duke University in 1991.

				Teaching Overview
			</h3>
			<div class="mx-3">
			<p>
				My teaching has primarily focused on computer security
				and core theory, algorithms, and data structures topics,
				although I have taught classes covering a wide range of
				other topics as well. In my final semester at UNC Greensboro (Spring 2025),
				I taught:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="/classes/452.s25/index.html">CSC 452/652: Theory of Computation</a></li>
				<li><a href="/classes/481.s25/index.html">CSC 481/681: Principles of Computer Security</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Since retiring from full-time work, I am available for teaching
				on a part-time basis, and in Summer 2025 I taught at the University of California
				at Berkeley:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://su25.eecs70.org/">CS 70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Teaching also covers student mentoring, and I have
				supervised a number of Ph.D. students, M.S. students,
				and undergraduate Honors students.

				Research Overview
			</h3>
			<div class="mx-3">
			<p class="mt-2">
				I started doing computer science research in the 1980s, working on problems in complexity and algorithms, with applications in arithmetic and algebraic circuits as well as robotics. After graduate school, I did a postdoc funded by NASA, working on data compression algorithms. My work in algorithms (and in particular online and dynamic algorithms) continued during the 1990s, and around 2000 I shifted into cryptography and security work after that. While I'm not as active in research as I was in the past, I'm still interested in security, with a particular interest in software security.
