CSC 330 or permission of instructor.  Students who are currently
enrolled in CSC 330 and are interested in taking this class are
welcome to seek permission, assuming they have had excellent
performance in CSC 130 and CSC 230, and have programming experience
outside of just those two classes.
<P><P><B>Brief Description:</B>
This class will cover computational problem-solving techniques. Part
of the course will involve going through <EM>Programming Pearls</EM> by Jon
Bentley, a classic and one of the best "problem solving with
programming" books ever written. The rest of the course will revolve
around solving programming problems similar to the challenges found in
programming contests, identifying common structure and problem solving
techniques. The problems that we consider will have two
characteristics:  They are hard to solve (if not impossible) without
writing a program, and a programming solution exists that is
relatively succinct (typically under 100 lines).  This is not about
system building or writing production software -- it's about solving an
immediate problem that you need an answer to.
<P>Please note the emphasis on problem solving.  This course is
<EM>not</EM> about the mechanical aspects of programming, such as
syntax or basic logic.  You should already be fluent in a
high-level programming language (preferably Java or C++). If you
must refer to programming language references when you are writing programs,
you will probably not be able to complete the work in this
class.
<P><P><B>Student Learning Outcomes:</B> 
Upon successful completion of this course, students will have
demonstrated an ability to
<UL><LI>write programs to solve advanced computational problems;
<LI>analyze several alternative solutions to determine the best
  approach;
<LI>justify that a program correctly solves a given problem.
</UL>
An additional outcome, although difficult to measure and assess, is
that students should build a better intuitive sense of problem solving
through programming.

<P><P><B>Required Book:</B>  Jon Bentley.  <A HREF="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/"><I>Programming Pearls
    (second edition)</I></A>.  
ACM Press, New York, 2000.
<P><P><B>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</B> This class will meet twice per
week, for 75 minutes each meeting.  As this class if focused on using
programming to solve problems, there will be a <EM>lot</EM> of
programming.  We will write programs in class, and you will have
programs to write for homework every week.  Class materials will all
be in a "C-like" procedural language -- the <EM>Programming
  Pearls</EM> book uses C-like pseudocode as well as, in places, real code
in either C or C++.  In-class programming will be done in either Java
or C++, depending on the problem and the wishes of the class.  
<P>Students may program in any approved language that they are
comfortable with, where "approved languages" include at least C,
C++, Java, and Python.  Student programs will be submitted using a
web-based submission system, which will run some automated tests and
provide some immediate feedback to the user.  This system needs to be
set up and tested for each approved language, so if you want to use
something other than C, C++, Java, or Python, talk to the instructor
as early as possible to see if it is possible.  Programs will be
graded based on both correctness and elegance (which includes style
and algorithmic decisions).
<P>In a typical week, there will be four programs assigned: two required
programs that everyone is expected to do, and two challenge
programs that are more difficult problems to solve and will earn
"Ninja Points" (see below).  There may be occasions where one of
the required programs will be replaced by a written exercise (such as
writing up a justification that a program correctly solves a problem).
<P><P><B>Ninja Points:</B> 
The required programs are the minimal expectations for this class, and
students can earn a passing (but not good) grade by doing just those programs.
There will be opportunities every week to go beyond the minimal
expectations, by solving more challenging problems, doing extra
activities, or performing tasks particularly well.  These earn one of two
types of "ninja points." <EM>Base</EM> ninja points are points that
everyone can earn -- for example, each challenge program can be done
by everyone, and each solution provides a certain number of base ninja
points.  <EM>Extra</EM> ninja points are competitive -- for example,
there might be a competition for the fastest solution to a problem,
with the winner or winners receiving extra ninja points.  Part of your
final grade depends on how many ninja points you earn during the
semester: these are scaled so that if your total is at least half of
the possible base ninja points, you will receive the full 20% of the
final grade allocated to ninja points.  A "scoreboard" of ninja
point totals will be available on blackboard so that you can track
your progress, and at the end of the semester,
the student with the most ninja points will win a "Programming
Ninja" T-shirt.
<P><B>Final Challenge:</B> 
At the end of the semester, in place of a final exam there will be a
programming challenge.  More details will provided on this later in
the semester.
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each assignment will be labeled with the
number of points that it will count, relative to other assignments.
Scores will be combined to produce a final average according to the
following weighting scheme:

<P><P><B>Reading:</B>
As described above, each week will start with a discussion of one
"column" from the <EM>Programming Pearls</EM> book.  The table below
gives the due date for each reading -- you should read each column
before this date, and make notes about questions you have and lessons you
have learned.  Read through the questions at the end of the chapter,
and think about solutions (hints and solutions are available at the
back of the book).  Class discussion will not repeat the material from
the reading, but will build upon it, so it is vital that you do the
required reading before class!

<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B>   Students are expected to be familiar
with and abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online
at 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>
<P>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise.  General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assignments should not be discussed and any submitted work should be
entirely your own.  Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be
handled strictly, resulting in either a zero on the assignment or an F
in the class, depending on the severity of the incident, and incidents
will be reported to the appropriate UNCG office.
<P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for everything done
or said in class (this can include changes in assignments, due dates,
etc.).  The sole source of information for much of the problem-solving
techniques that are needed to solve the programming problems will be
in-class discussions, and doing the required work without regularly
attending class meetings would be very difficult.
<P>The university allows for a limited number of excused absences for
religious observances. Students who plan to take such an absence
should notify the instructor at least two weeks in advance so that
accommodations can be made (also see the late work policy below).  It
is the student's responsibility to obtain notes from another student
if they miss class.
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Students are encouraged to bring laptops to class, if possible, and
write programs along with the class.  However, laptops should not be
used for checking e-mail, chatting, or other entertainment during class
time.  This class has a strict "no non-class related use" rule for
laptops -- if you are found violating this policy, then your in-class
laptop privileges will be taken away.  Cellphones are a distraction
for everyone, and should be turned off during class.  If there is a
special situation where you need to have your phone on for a
particular day, please let the instructor know the situation before
class.
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, and
late submissions will not be accepted.  Keep up with your work!
Students with planned absences, whether for university events,
religious observance, or other reason, are expected to make
arrangements with the instructor to turn in work
before the due date.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B>  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
