<P><P><B>Prerequisites:</B>
None.
<P><P><B>Catalog Description:</B>
A broad-based introduction to key concepts and principles of computer
science.  Exploration of seven big ideas of computing: creativity,
abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and impact
of computing.
<P><P><B>Who This Course is For:</B> This course is for two types of
students: non-majors who want to learn more about computing and
computer science, and as an optional pre-major course for computer
science majors who are just beginning and haven't taken the
traditional first computer science class (CSC 130).  The course is
designed so that students build the problem solving and critical thinking
skills related to computing (i.e., "computational thinking" skills)
that are becoming vital 21st century skills across a wide variety of
interests and disciplines.  For beginning computer science majors, the
foundational skills built in this course are designed to improve
success in later computer science courses.
<P><P><B>Full Course Description:</B>
This course is part of a recent effort to create a new class offered
through both high schools (as an Advanced Placement "<A HREF="https://advancesinap.collegeboard.org/stem/computer-science-principles">CS
  Principles</A>" class) and
colleges, with a goal of making computer science education accessible
and relevant to a broad audience. 
The CSC 100 course at UNCG is designed around the same student
learning outcomes as the CS Principles curriculum, and high school
students who score a 3 or above on the AP exam receive credit for this
class upon entering UNCG (students who receive credit for the AP class
should not take this class at UNCG!).  The high-level purpose and
goals of the course are described by the College Board AP document as
follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE>AP Computer Science Principles introduces students to the central
ideas of computer science, instilling the ideas and practices of
computational thinking, and inviting students to understand how
computing changes the world. Students develop innovative computational
artifacts using the same creative processes artists, writers, computer
scientists, and engineers use to bring ideas to life.
<P>To appeal to a broader audience, including those often
underrepresented in computing, this course emphasizes the vital impact
advances in computing have on people and society. The course goes
beyond the study of machines and systems and gives students the
opportunity to investigate computing innovations that span a variety
of interests and to examine the ethical implications of these new
technologies.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not a "computer literacy" class or a "computer
programming" class, although at the end students will have a better
understanding of how computers work and will have gained some
experience in computer programming.  Rather, this class is about how
to think about problems and solutions in a world that is increasingly
data-rich and reliant on computing tools and techniques.
<P><P><B>Student Learning Outcomes:</B> 
Upon completion of this course students will be able to
<OL><LI>use programming and computing tools in creative expression,
creating and analyzing artifacts (creativity);
<LI>devise and use multiple levels of abstraction in computation,
including the use of models and simulations to raise and answer
questions (abstraction);
<LI>use computing to examine large datasets and facilitate exploration
in order to gain insight and knowledge (data and information);
<LI>devise, express, and evaluate algorithms for solving computational
problems (algorithms);
<LI>create and evaluate a correct program to implement an algorithm,
using abstraction to manage complexity (programming);
<LI>explain characteristics of the Internet and systems built on it,
including issues of cybersecurity and privacy (Internet);
<LI>analyze beneficial and harmful effects of computing, connecting
computing to economic, social, and cultural contexts and innovations in
other fields (impact).
</OL>
<P><P><B>Textbook and Readings:</B>  This class is organized around readings
and lab exercises that are distributed through the class web page.  We
will regularly discuss readings from the following book, which is
available online for free, or you can purchase a hardcopy if you prefer:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis.  <EM>Blown to Bits: Your
    Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion.</EM>
  Addison-Wesley, 2008 (online version available at
  <A HREF="http://www.bitsbook.com">http://www.bitsbook.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</B> Students are expected to
participate responsibly in course activities, including class and lab
sessions, assignments, and enrichment activities. These are described
in more detail below.
<P><P><I>Attendance/Participation:</I> This class will meet for two
lectures and one mixed lecture/lab per week, and students are expected
to be in class on time. Students should prepare for class by
completing assigned readings, and are expected to participate
in class discussions.
<P><P><I>Exams:</I> The mid-term and final exam will cover topics
discussed in lecture and emphasized through lab exercises and
homeworks.  Questions will cover all 7 of the defined student learning
outcomes.
<P><P><I>Readings/Discussion:</I> Students will explore the impact of
technology on society through a series of readings from the book
<EM>Blown to Bits</EM>, as well as other sources. Each major reading
will take place during a two-week timeframe: in the first week,
students are expected to read the material and answer "reading
reflection" questions in Canvas; during the second week students
will participate in an on-line discussion of the reading with
classmates and the instructor, where everyone is expected to
contribute to the discussion. At the end of the on-line discussion
period we will have a brief in-class wrap-up discussion.
<P><P><I>Lab Exercises:</I> Lab exercises involve programming in various
languages/systems and utilizing a variety of computational tools.
Student work products include programs that they create, or
modifications of programs provided by the instructor. Each lab
exercise contains some pre-lab work (which students must do
<EM>before</EM> coming to lab), a short quiz to check
understanding of the pre-lab material, the actual activities to perform
in the lab, and an explanation of how the lab exercise and concepts
fit into the bigger picture of computer science. Lab activities will
utilize <A HREF="http://www.realsearchgroup.org/pairlearning/index.php"><EM>pair
    programming</EM></A>,
where pairs of students work together on a single computer, taking
turns as the <EM>driver</EM> and the <EM>navigator</EM>.  After each
lab, students will individually take an on-line quiz (due the
following Monday) to test how
well they have mastered the concepts in that lab.  Exercises are
concrete demonstrations of topics being discussed, and each lab
session will start with a mini-lecture on relevant topics and an
opportunity for students to ask questions about the pre-lab reading
and exercises.
The final lab sessions will be dedicated to guided work on student
projects.  Lab exercises are available on the class web site, both
under "Lab Exercises" and linked from the class schedule.
<P><P><I>Homeworks:</I> Homeworks consist of independent student work that
is less guided than lab work.  Homeworks may involve programming,
independent research of some topic, or written exercises and
analysis. Homeworks often include open-ended aspects in which students
can demonstrate their own particular creativity.  Students will
typically have two weeks to complete homework.  No homeworks will be
given in the last month of the semester, when students will be working
on their projects.
<P><P><I>Project:</I> Students will work in teams of 2 or 3 people to
produce some creative software product (an animation, game, tool,
etc.), and will work on this project during the final month of the
semester.  At the end of the semester there will be a "project
showcase" in which students present and demonstrate their projects
for the class.  Students will vote on the projects, and the winning
project will receive a "Student's Choice Award."
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each student work product will be
graded, and the student's final grade will be determined by assigning
each category of work a weighted score according to the following
distribution:

<P><P><I>Professionalism and Work Quality:</I> While the objectives of
this class deal with technical issues, students should at all times
produce high quality, neat, and grammatically correct work. Spelling
and grammar reflect substantially on your seriousness and
professionalism, and sloppy or grammatically incorrect work will
result in up to 10% being taken off the grade, even if all technical
information is correct. Professional behavior is also expected in class,
where you should exhibit the same behavior you would use if you were attending
business meetings: you should be on time, engaged, and respectful of
others.
<P><P>The final weighted average will be assigned a letter grade according to
the following table (exact borderline cases will be given the higher
grade - for example, a student with a weighted average of 90 will earn
an A-).

<P><P><B>Topic Outline and Calendar:</B>
For the current and planned list of topics and dates, please see the
"Schedule" area of the class web site.
<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B> Each student is required to abide by the
UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on all work in the course.
Refer to 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu">http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu</A>
or the UNCG Undergraduate Bulletin
for more information.  Some assignments and exercises may involve
teamwork, pair programming, or group discussion.  When portions of
these assignments or exercises are to be done individually, they will
be clearly marked as such, and work turned in should be entirely your
own.  On all work that you turn in, work or ideas that are not your
own should be clearly marked and a citation should be given (a list of
team members or collaborators, external references, etc.).
<P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> 
Attendance will be taken, and students may be
dropped from the course if they have more than three unexcused
absences.  The university allows for a limited number of excused
absences for religious observances - students who plan to take such an
absence should notify the instructor at least two weeks in advance so
that accommodations can be made (also see below for
"late work and makeup exams").
 It is the student's responsibility to obtain notes
from another student if they miss class.
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> Assigned work is due at the
beginning of class on the due date, and will not be accepted late.
Exams, labs, and in-class work must be done on the scheduled day, in class.
In cases of serious medical situations (which must be documented with
a doctor's excuse), some exceptions can be made.  Students with
planned absences, whether for university events, religious observance,
or other reason, are expected to make arrangements with the instructor
to turn in assignments or take exams before the scheduled date of the
assignment or test.
<P><B>Final Exam:</B>  The final exam will be held according to the
official UNCG Final Exam Schedule, which lists the time for this exam
as Wednesday, December 6, 12:00 - 3:00.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B> UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Accessibility
Resources and Services located in 215 Elliott University Center: (336)
334-5440 (or <A HREF="http://ods.uncg.edu"><CODE>http://ods.uncg.edu</CODE></A>).
<P><P><B>University Closings:</B>  If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Canvas site for information about if and how the class will
proceed. 
<P><P><B>Commercial note-taking services:</B> Selling class notes for
commercial gain or purchasing such class notes in this or any other
course at UNCG is a violation of the University's Copyright Policy and
of the Student Code of Conduct.  Sharing notes for studying purposes,
or borrowing notes to make up for absences, without commercial gain,
are not violations.
