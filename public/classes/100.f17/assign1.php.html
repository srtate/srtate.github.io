    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Homework 1 - Due Monday, September 18</H1>
    
    
    <P>This is an open-ended assignment, where you have a lot of
flexibility to demonstrate some creativity. You will create your own
pen/turtle drawing blocks in Snap!, and use them to draw a cool picture. What is
the picture? You decide! The artistic product isn't what is really
important here -- what is important is your use of abstraction in
creating your own blocks to draw the picture. Here are the
requirements:
<UL><LI>You must create at least three new custom blocks, each of which
    draws something -- these must be <EM>new</EM>, and should not
    repeat the drawing blocks you created in labs.
<LI>At least one of your blocks must be used in the code that defines
  another one of your blocks! In other words, one object that you are
  drawing must contain multiple other objects that are drawn by a custom
  block.
<LI>You must utilize color, and your picture can't be monochromatic
  (one color).
<LI>You should use different pen sizes to draw different width lines.
<LI>Your final drawing should include at least 8 different top-level
  objects.
</UL>
To get you thinking about this, here are two examples. You could draw
a field of at least eight flowers of different colors, where each flower is drawn
by a custom block, which uses another custom block to draw leaves on
the stem or petals. Or you could draw a village made up of many
houses, where your block that draws a house uses other blocks you
create to draw doors or windows.
<P>I'm sure you can come up with other ideas that fit the
criteria above!
<P><B>For the final five points:</B> If you want a chance at making a
100 on this assignment, your drawing blocks must be <EM>scalable</EM>,
and your final drawing should use different sizes to give some sense
of <EM>perspective</EM> (objects further away are drawn at a smaller
scale). To do this, each drawing block should take a 
"percent size" parameter, where percentages greater than 100 produce
larger pictures, and percentages less than 100 produce smaller
pictures. If you think about drawing a leaf, your code would then
adjust the amount of distance it moves on each step based on this
percentage. This is actually a little trickier than you would suspect
at first, so do this part after you have a good solution to the basic
drawing problem. Save your original solution, and work on this using a
different filename, so you don't accidentally destroy your original
solution!
