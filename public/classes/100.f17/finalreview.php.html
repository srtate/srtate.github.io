    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CSC 100 Review for Final Exam</H1>
    
    <P>This document gives information to help you study for the final exam
in CSC 100. The format of the final exam will be similar to the
midterm: some terminology (matching) and some short answer questions,
including both explanation/discussion type questions and some simple
Snap!/Python code writing and
interpretation. The final will include questions from throughout the
semester, but will focus primarily on material since the midterm. As a
rough estimate, expect about 20% of the exam to cover material from
the first part of the semester, and 80% on the material after the
midterm. Questions from before the midterm will focus on topics
covered on the midterm exam -- if you study from that exam and
understand the answers you should be fine (but the key is
<EM>understanding the answers</EM>, not just memorizing them).
<P>There are three primary sources of topics: lectures, labs, and
readings. As a suggestion for studying, I would recommend taking the
following lists and expanding them to outline all the basic topics and
making lists of terminology. Use your notes as a guide, and see the
lecture slides on the class web page for additional information. You should
also review lab write-ups and the provided solutions.  Then think up
questions about the material that we covered, and write out answers
-- don't just look at the questions and say "OK, I know that"
because people are really good at fooling themselves! By forcing
yourself to write out answers to questions, you really have to address
the questions and not just skip over them. The best approach for most
people is to organize study groups so you can ask each other
questions, but you can still do this fairly effectively if you are
studying on your own.
