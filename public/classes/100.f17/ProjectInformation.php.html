<center><h1>CSC 100 Final Project</h1></center>
<p class="western">Over the final
four weeks of this class (leading up to the Thanksgiving break), you
will work on a project of your own design. Students will team up to
produce some creative software product using
either Snap! or Python, such
as a game, educational program, tool, interactive animation, etc.
Python programs can either
be text-based or graphical
(turtle graphics or sprites).
<i>Groups can be either two
or three students</i>, and
three-student groups will be expected to do proportionally more work
than two-student groups.</p>
<p class="western">The goal of this
assignment is to give you some experience with developing a
reasonably complex application. Your experience with programming so
far has been limited mainly to guided labs and homework assignments;
whether you realize it or not, you've already gained a lot of
programming knowledge over the course of the semester. This project
is designed to let you use all of this new knowledge to produce
something that is interesting, useful, and challenging for you. We
want to unleash your creativity as much as possible, so the purpose
of your project will really be up to you and the other people on your
team. But keep in mind that this is a computer science class and not
an art class: your first priority is to spend time designing
algorithms and writing code, not just making cool graphics and
sprites. See below for a list of basic project requirements.</p>
<p class="western">At the last lab
meeting of the semester there will be a &quot;project showcase&quot;
in which students present and demonstrate their projects for the
class. Students will vote on the projects, and the winning project
will receive a &quot;Student's Choice Award.&quot;</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.w8bk9zsiv7ix"></a>
Timeline and Due Dates</h2>
<p class="western">The project will
proceed in stages, with regular deliverables and activities. For all
major deliverables there should be one submission per group, but make
sure all project team member names are included on any written
submission. The one exception is the teamwork reflection that is due
from each student individually (see below under "Final
Deliverables"). The following table summarizes due dates. Unless
otherwise specified, all deliverables are due before class or lab
(i.e., they are due at 10:00 AM).</p>

<p class="western">Details for each
part are described below.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
Graphics, Sound, Copyright, and
Licenses</h2>
<p class="western">Most people will make a program with some graphics
and/or sound component. While it is tempting to think you can just
grab things off the Internet, you <i>may not use any media (graphics
or sound) that you do not have the rights to</i><span style="font-style: normal">
(in this class or anywhere else!). This is very important, and I will
not accept any project that includes material </span><span style="font-style: normal">that
you don't have the legal right to use</span><span style="font-style: normal">.
If you submit something that includes </span><span style="font-style: normal">such
items</span><span style="font-style: normal">, you will get a zero on
the project. You </span><span style="font-style: normal">are required</span><span style="font-style: normal">
to document the source for all of your project resources in your
final report. Fortunately, there are a lot of generous people out
there that create graphics and sound that you can use for free! Here
are some examples:</span></p>

<h2 style="line-height: 115%"><a name="h.o64uhieoitsl"></a>Project
Proposal: Presentation and Written Proposal</h2>
<p class="western">We will spend some time in class organizing
students into groups with similar interests, and the first major
thing that teams must do is a proposal presentation. Each team will
have a total of 8 minutes, and should plan for 3-4 minutes to present
their ideas and about the same amount of time for
discussion/feedback. The purpose of these presentations is to help
you focus your ideas, and to get good and creative ideas from other
students. <i>All students are expected to be engaged in these
discussions</i> &ndash; you will get a small participation grade during
these presentations, so if you don't contribute to the discussion
of some other group's project you will not get any of these points.</p>
<p class="western">A written project proposal is due Wednesday
following your presentation. This will give you the opportunity to
incorporate any good ideas you get from the proposal discussions.
This document should be one to two pages, double-spaced. Start with
two or three paragraphs that describe the overarching purpose of your
project. Is it a game? Educational software? A utility? A sound-based
application? After describing the main purpose, discuss the &quot;scope&quot;
of the project: the types of things users will and will not be able
to do with it. This can include a basic plot line for a game or
animation, a list of options for a utility, and so on. Finally,
prioritize your project scope: list things that it must do, and
things that you'd like for it to do. You need to submit <i>something
that works</i>, so prioritizing this way will ensure that you can
submit something even if you don't get to all of your (hopefully a
little ambitious) plans.</p>
<p class="western">This is a mostly non-technical document and should
describe big ideas more than the technical details of how it will be
done. I will discuss your project proposal with you if I have
questions about feasibility: in particular, I'm interested in
gauging the level of difficulty of the project, the estimated
workload, design choices, and potential pitfalls. <i>Note:</i>
although you will be able to tweak your project idea after your
proposal has been submitted, the gist of it should stay the same.
Make sure that you're happy with your idea since you'll be spending a
good bit of time with it.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.iart5s54pe1k"></a>
Progress Report</h2>
<p class="western">This document should again be one to two pages,
double-spaced. You should describe what progress you have made
towards completing your project &ndash; among other things, you should
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">the general breakdown of work among the
	members of your project group,</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">what milestones you have set and which have
	been met,</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">what problems you have encountered and how
	you overcame them,</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">whether (and how) your project has changed
	from when you first described it in the project proposal, and</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">what is left to be done.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">This should be a reasonably technical document.
Feel free to talk about particular functions or blocks if it helps
you communicate your solution. You can also briefly discuss your
algorithms for particularly complex problems. Bear in mind that by
this point, you should have completed approximately two thirds of
your project.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.t1d83blylx5l"></a>
Final Project Demo and
Presentation</h2>
<p class="western">Your project should be finished and working before
the project presentation. You should create a presentation and demo
for your project. Each team will have approximately 7 minutes, and
each team member must have a significant (at least 2 minutes)
speaking role in this presentation. In addition to demonstrating how
your program works, you should talk about individual responsibilities
within the project, what challenges you encountered, and what you
learned.</p>
<p class="western">You should save your project code and presentation
PowerPoint on a USB flash drive so that you can efficiently bring up
your materials during your presentation. While you are not required
to use the following format, it is strongly suggested (if you want to
deviate from this, it would be a good idea to discuss your ideas with
the instructor first):</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Title Slide &ndash; Project Title, Team
	Members, Date</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">1 Slide on project purpose and why you
	chose it</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">1-4 Slides with an overview of the
	implementation design</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">1 Slide summarizing what challenges you
	encountered, and how you dealt with them</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">And then demonstrate your project! Note that due
to the number of projects that must be presented, your time is
limited &ndash; if you create a long animation, you might have to create
a special version for the presentation that extracts some interesting
smaller pieces that can fit into the time limits.</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.rhz7qacwpkv2"></a>
Project Submission</h2>
<p class="western">The final deadline for the project is <b>Wednesday,
December </b><b>6</b><b>, 201</b><b>7</b><b> at noon</b>. Note that
this is the time for the final exam, so plan ahead! Each team will
submit <b>three items:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Your program &ndash; if you use Snap!, you can
	use the "submit" option under "the G" menu. If you use
	Python, you should submit your Python files and any support files
	(graphics, etc.) in Canvas.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">The PowerPoint slides from your
	presentation.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">A report that includes one page with basic
	instructions for how a user would run and interact with your
	program, and 2-3 pages that give a summary of significant
	programming components of your project. This second part should
	describe your basic design: how you partitioned the work between
	program pieces (sprites, blocks, functions, ...), what functions or
	blocks you defined and why they made sense as abstractions. How did
	you use lists in your project? Talk about how your project works on
	an abstract level, in terms of programming components working with
	each other. You don't need to go into detail, because I will have
	the code too. You must include a section in your report where you
	describe the source for any artwork or sound used in your project.
	Did you create them yourself? If you downloaded freely-usable
	materials from the Internet, include a URL for the website that
	provided the material.</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">Only one person should submit these three items
for the team, but make sure you have all team member names on the
report. Some of your projects may be huge in terms of file size. Make
sure that you use efficient, compressed formats for things like
images and sounds whenever possible.</p>
<p class="western">Finally, <i>each individual should submit a short
report</i> (1/3 to 1/2 page) describing how you felt your team
functioned. Did you think there was sufficient and effective team
communication? Did everyone contribute a fair share of the work? What
lessons did you learn about teamwork that will affect how you
approach team projects in the future?</p>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.30qcdplu6q4d"></a>
Basic Project Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">There must be a clear way to start your
	program. In Python, it is recommended that you have a function named
	run(), so that typing run() in the Python Shell runs your program.
	In Snap!, using the green flag is the recommended approach.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">If you create a game, it can be either a
	creative game or a game with a purpose (a mind-expanding puzzle
	game, training game, educational game, etc.).</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">All programs should be interactive. If you
	do an animation, it should involve significant user interaction &ndash;
	it's a program, not a movie!</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">&quot;Style&quot; points will be awarded
	for things like well-designed code. Poor structure can include
	things like duplicated code, needlessly complicated organization or
	program flow, and so on.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Create some of your own functions and
	blocks. Proper abstractions are a must!</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Use lists in your project in some way.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">You cannot work alone, but can either work
	in pairs or groups of three. Expectations will be higher for larger
	groups.</p>
</ul>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"><a name="h.lbbqa4h47j36"></a>
Project Ideas and Sources of
Inspiration</h2>
<p class="western">Here are some ideas of both types of projects and
specific ideas that should get you thinking about possibilities:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Game-based AI Agent: Write a program that
	can play a game involving chance, like Yahtzee, Monopoly, or poker.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Puzzle Solver: Write a program that can
	solve and/or generate sudokus, word searches, crossword puzzles,
	etc.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Tutorials: Write a program that teaches the
	user about some topic (a topic from computer science, music, math,
	...)</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Art Generator: Write a program that can
	generate images, music, etc.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Modeling Algorithms: Write a program to
	simulate and analyze different strategies for solving a problem,
	such as different ways to serve customers at a store (one line for
	multiple registers vs multiple lines?), ways to board a plane (front
	to back or window to aisle?), ways to pack a truck (as packages come
	in or order largest to smallest?), ...</p>
</ul>
<p class="western">Do not use another person's project to start
creating your own &ndash; your project should be entirely your own
creation. Nevertheless, getting inspiration from other projects,
programs, etc. is encouraged.  The Berkeley class that this one is
patterned after has their project students make videos that demo
their projects &ndash; here are a few that look particularly good:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Texas Holdem (Snap!):
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_EcccPTqio">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_EcccPTqio</a></p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Minesweeper (Snap!):
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsOn4eBn1Og">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsOn4eBn1Og</a></p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Monopoly (Python, text based):
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxgIizk3Wg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHxgIizk3Wg</a></p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Snake (Python, text based):
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ipHzFiaelQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ipHzFiaelQ</a></p>
</ul>
<p class="western">And if you want to see a really ambitious project
and video, check this one out:</p>
<ul>

<p class="western">Sudoku (Snap!):
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAzgt4AGbY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yAzgt4AGbY</a></p>
</ul>
<h2 style="line-height: 115%">A
Word of Warning</h2>
<p class="western">Getting to design projects of your own can be
exciting, and it is very easy to underestimate how long it will take
to accomplish a particular goal. Remember: although we are happy to
help you bring your idea to life, you won't have lab-like guidelines
for making this happen. It may take a lot longer to make your project
than you think! That being said, don't hold back if you think you can
make something truly grand. We're here to help you if you've got an
idea that you love.</p>

Tips</b></u></p>
<p class="western" style="line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Save and checkpoint often. This may entail
	creating multiple versions of your project to act as backups.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Begin with functionality, and then start
	adding assets (custom-made sprites, imported lists, sounds, music,
	etc.) only <i><b>after</b></i> you've gotten your scripts working
	correctly. For lists, define test lists in your program that you can
	use for testing. In Python these can just be lists assigned to a
	variable, and in Snap! you can use either the "list" reporter
	block, or create a script that constructs a test list.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Test each of your functions/blocks
	thoroughly. You don't construct a skyscraper and then start
	checking the first floor for structural problems. Test each part as
	you go along, and build from a solid foundation.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Choose <i>descriptive</i> variable,
	function/block, sprite, etc. names. Follow sensible naming
	conventions, and if you work independently with the intent of
	merging your work, make sure you plan out names of objects so that
	the merging goes smoothly.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">Minimize the number of "global variables"
	that you have (variables that can be seen and/or modified by all of
	the sprites). These tend to cause hard-to-track-down bugs. Use local
	variables or "script variables" whenever possible.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">If a complex function/block isn't working
	correctly, start pulling pieces out of it and test each one
	individually (aka "Unit Testing"). Give the isolated block a set
	of known inputs, determine what the output should be, and <i>then</i>
	compare the results.</p>
	<li/>
<p class="western">One more time: <i><u><b>save
	and backup often</b></u></i>!</p>
