    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CSC 330 Java Coding Style Rules</H1>
    
    <P>These rules are based on the original standard <EM>Code Conventions
  for the Java Programming Language</EM>, produced by Sun (the original
creators of Java) and available at
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER>
<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html"><TT>http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html</TT></A>
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
While these code conventions are no longer actively maintained, they
form the basis of most professional style guidelines for Java, such as
Google's <A HREF="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">Java Style
  Guide</A>.  You are
expected to follow these style guidelines for all programming
assignments in this class, although you will not lose points for
following the style from either the CSC 230 book (see Appendix A) or
the CSC 330 book (no style guidelines are explicitly stated in the
book, but are implied through their code examples).
<OL><P><LI>Required comments at the top of every file include: your name,
  assignment number, a brief (one line) description of what is in the
  file, the last date modified, and a statement that you followed the
  UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on the assignment. This is slightly
  different from the <EM>Code Conventions</EM>, because we're in a class
  setting.
<P><LI><EM>All</EM> data elements in a class should be private, or
possibly of package or protected scope if there is a compelling reason
for this.
<P><LI>Proper indentation is an absolute must!  Consistently use 2-4
characters for each indentation level -- the exact number of spaces
is up to your personal taste, but be consistent!
<P><LI>All lines should be at most 80 characters long.
<P><LI>Use whitespace and blank lines to increase readability.
<P><LI>Use meaningful but concise names for classes, methods, and
variables.  Class names should be nouns, begin with a capital letter, and
each word of a multi-word name should start with a capital letter
(Examples: <CODE>Tree</CODE>, <CODE>BinaryTree</CODE>, and
<CODE>BinarySearchTree</CODE>).  Method names should be verbs, start with a
lower case letter, and start subsequent words with upper case letters
(Examples: <CODE>setData()</CODE>, <CODE>isEmpty()</CODE>, and <CODE>getNext()</CODE>).
Variables in a class should start with a lower case letter and
capitalize subsequent words (like method names), but should be nouns
(Examples: <CODE>root</CODE>, <CODE>rightChild</CODE>, and <CODE>vertexList</CODE>).
Local variables in a function should also have meaningful names, with
an exception being for simple loop variables (<CODE>i</CODE> is ok for an
integer loop, <CODE>x</CODE> for a variable in numeric code, etc.).
<P><LI>Should consistently order class definitions as follows:  static
variables, instance variables, constructors, and finally the methods
(grouped by functionality).
<P><LI>Use modular, multi-file construction.
Each source file should contain only <EM>one</EM> public class or
interface (although a file may include private classes or nested
classes in support of the main public class should be in the same
file).
<P><LI>Provide constructors to make sure objects are initialized
    properly.
<P><LI>Variables should be declared with as narrow a scope as possible,
  including declaring loop variables in a for statement. If a variable
  is only used within a single block, it should be declared within
  that block. <EM>Never</EM> declare a variable outside of a method
  unless it is truly part of the object or class state (i.e., don't
  use an instance variable as a lazy way to pass values from one
  method to another). Local variables should be declared as close to their
  first use a possible, and should always be initialized.
<P><LI>Use parentheses for grouping expressions, especially 
  precedence is not obvious.
<P><LI>Use braces around every block of code, including single-line
  blocks after an "if" statement or loop construct. I prefer
  "Egyptian style" brace placement, which puts open braces at the
  end of lines rather than on a line by itself (this is fairly
  universal in professional style guides, but almost every
  introductory programming book does it differently).
<P><LI>Put comments before each function or method, and at the
beginning of each source file.  Your comments should in
"javadoc style," which allows a
description of your class to be extracted and formatted in HTML.  Make
sure you clearly state the purpose of each method, what parameters the
method expects, and the meaning of the return value (if any).  Rule of
thumb:  I should have all the information I need to call a function
and interpret the results by looking only at the function comments (I
shouldn't have to look at the code at all).
<P><LI>Comment unclear parts of the code, although your goal should be
  to make code as clear as possible so that it is "self-documenting"
  and does not need additional explanation. Comments are very
  helpful with variable declarations, if there is information that is
  not clear from the variable name (how it's used, assumptions about
  legal values, etc.).
<P><LI>Don't improvise -- if there's no rule stated, but all code you
  see is written a particular way, imitate that and don't make up your
  own non-standard style.
