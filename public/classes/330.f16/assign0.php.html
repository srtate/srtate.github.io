    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 0 - Due Thursday, September 1</H1>
    
    
    <P><EM>Note: This is a "test assignment" to try out a new process
  using Bitbucket to manage assignments and submissions. You will
  receive a grade, but it will only be out of 20 points instead of the
  usual 100 points.</EM>
<P><B>Context:</B> Version control systems (like git, subversion, and
mercurial) are one of the most important kinds of tools that a
professional developer uses on a daily basis. There are several online
services, like GitHub and Bitbucket, that enhance a basic version
control system with various other tools for effective teamwork, such
as issue trackers and communication tools. We are going to experiment
with using <A HREF="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</A> and git in this
class to manage assignments and student submissions. Use of git will
be somewhat simplistic since we don't have team assignments, but there
are several benefits to this approach for CSC 330. First, this gives
you some experience with a very powerful tool, even if we
only use a small part of it. Second, git is designed for managing
multi-file programming projects, and so is a much better way to manage
and submit programming work than Canvas. Third, we will talk a little
about features that are useful even in a single-developer setting,
such as the use of branches to test out ideas that may or may not
work. And finally, git support is integrated into NetBeans, so after
you initialize your project through the Bitbucket web site your work
(including assignment submission) is done directly in NetBeans.
<P>This is an experiment for this semester, and we haven't tried this
before. The main goal of this assignment is to test out the ideas and
see if they are promising enough to use throughout the semester.
<OL><LI>First, you need to create a free account at
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org"><CODE>https://bitbucket.org</CODE></A>. At the
web site, click the green "Get started" button to sign up for an
account, which will bring up a screen asking for your email
address. <EM><U>Use your UNCG email here, not a personal
    email.</U></EM> After entering your email, you will go through a standard
process for creating an online account, which includes entering your
full name (use your real name!), selecting a password, and solving a
CAPTCHA. The system will send you an email, and you will need to use
the link in that email to confirm your account before your account is
enabled. In confirming your email, you will pick a username for your
account - it isn't all that important what you pick here, but use
something that isn't too long and is easy to remember.
<p>
<LI>Once you have completed the previous steps and your account is
created, send me an email to let me know that you created your
account. I will add you to a team named "UNCG CSC 330" as soon
as possible -- definitely within 24 hours.
<p>
<LI>Once you are a member of the "UNCG CSC 330" team, log in to the
Bitbucket web site, and you will see your "Dashboard" with
recently-updated repositories listed. While the "Assign0" repository
that you need for this assignment is probably visible, explore a
little to see what is possible. Click on the "Repositories" tab at
the top of the Dashboard, and you'll see that you can filter
repositories by Owner and Project. "Owner" will allow you to just
see the "UNCG CSC 330" repositories, and "Project" will allow you
to filter by in-class examples or assignments. Filter by project
"Assignments" and you'll see that at this time the only repository
is "Assign0." Now click "Assign0," which will take you to
the "Overview" screen for the repository.
<P>Depending on how wide your browser window is, you'll either see a menu
on the left of the page with actions and navigation options, or you'll
see a bar with icons that you can expand to the full menu by clicking
the double arrow at the bottom of the window. Expand the menu if you
need to, and then click "Fork" to make your own personal copy of the
"Assign0" repository. It will ask you for a name, which defaults to
"Assign0" -- I want you to add a dash and your UNCG username after
the name. For example, mine would be "Assign0-srtate." Once you have
made that change click the "Fork repository" button.
<p>
<LI>After forking, the web site will take you to the Overview page for
your new repository. Click the "Settings" command from the left
menu, and then select "Access management." Under groups, click the
"Select a group" dropdown menu and choose "ClassAdmin" and click
the "Add" button to give read access to the instructor and grader.
Finally, go back to the "Overview" screen and make a note of the URL
at the top - this is how you will access the repository from
NetBeans.
<p>
<LI>Start NetBeans, and from the "Team" menu at the top select "Git"
and "Clone..." This will bring up a window that asks for a
"Repository URL," and you should enter the URL from the previous
step. Enter your Bitbucket username and password below that, and then
click "Finish" at the bottom (you can also click through options
screens using "Next" if you prefer). A window should pop up saying
the project was cloned, and give you an option to open the project,
which you should do.
<p>
<LI>At this, point your project should appear in the NetBeans "Projects"
pane, and you can work with it like you would any other project. For
this assignment, if you go down into the source code, there is a
single Java source file that includes a comment with instructions on
what to change in the file. In addition to that change to the code,
put a comment with your name at the top of the file.
<p>
<LI>Once you have successfully made your changes, select the main project
entry ("Assignment0") in the project pane, right click on it, and go
down to "Git" and "Commit..."  It is vital that you do this from
the project name in the project pane, and <EM>not</EM> from the "Team"
menu! They may look the same, but the "Commit" in the "Team"
window will only commit a single file rather than the entire
project. In your commit window, type a brief commit message describing
what you have changed, and then click "Commit" at the bottom.
<p>
<LI>From the Team menu, select "Remote" and "Push to Upstream" to
update your files on Bitbucket.
<p>
<LI>Finally, on the Bitbucket web site, go to your repository (the one with
your username in the repository name) and click "Create pull
request" under "Actions" in the left menu. You can add a note under
"Description," but that isn't necessary.
