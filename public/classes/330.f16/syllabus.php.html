  Java</EM>, 4th edition, Addison Wesley, ISBN 0-321-54140-5.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P><B>Catalog Description:</B>  Static and dynamic data structures emphasizing
binary trees and graphs. Advanced programming techniques. Advanced
sorting and searching algorithms. Hashing techniques. Performance
analysis. Methods of developing large applications programs.
<P><P><B>Prerequisites:</B>  Students should have completed CSC 230 and
CSC 250 with a C or better in each. See the end of this handout for
detailed information on assumed background.
<P><P><B>Student Learning Outcomes:</B>
Upon successful completion of this course students will have
demonstrated that they
<OL><LI>understand and use advanced features of Java such as inheritance and generics;
<LI>can design divide-and-conquer algorithms using three steps and apply
  to merge sort, quick sort, dynamic programming, and backtracking;
<LI>understand tree representation and traversals;
<LI>understand associative containers, red-black trees, and hashing;
<LI>understand graph representations, traversals, and basic graph algorithms.
</OL>
<P><P><B>Class Structure:</B>
Class will meet twice a week for 75 minutes.  Class time will include
brief overviews of the material, but students are expected to have
completed the textbook readings before class so that the majority of class
time can be used for discussing the material, answering questions and
clarifying topics from the book, and working through examples.  If
students do not keep up with readings, the instructor may give
in-class quizzes or small reading-summary assignments as extra
motivation. On some days (which will be announced in advance) we may
meet in a computer lab.
<P><P><B>Assignments:</B> Assignments will be both written and programming.
Programs must be written in Java, and must compile and work correctly
in Netbeans version 8.1 with Java 8 (this is the version on the UNCG
Computer Lab machines, and is freely available to download and install
on your personal computers). The instructor will <EM>not</EM> make any
adjustments to a student's code when grading, so if any submitted
program does not compile the student will get a zero on the
"correctness" portion of the grade (or 50 points off the overall
grade), with no exceptions. More information on grading criteria and
program submission instructions will be distributed and discussed
before the first assignment.  Written assignment solutions must be
turned in on paper at the beginning of class (solutions can be
handwritten or typed).
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, and may
be turned in up to 7 calendar days late with a 25% late penalty.
Students with planned absences, whether for university events,
religious observance, or other reason, are expected to make
arrangements with the instructor to turn in assignments or take exams
before the scheduled date of the assignment or test.
<EM>No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after
  the original due date!</EM>
<P>Exam/test dates are on the schedule 
below
-- if there are
any changes, they will be announced at least two weeks in advance if
possible.  A
missed exam
may be made up <EM>only</EM> if it was missed due to an extreme
emergency and arrangements are made <EM>before</EM> the exam date.
Exams (including the final) may not be taken early or late due to
personal travel plans.
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each student activity will contribute to the
final grade in the class according to the following percentages.

<P><P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B>
Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do.  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."  For information on the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy,
see
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>. 
<P>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise.  General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assignments should not be discussed and any submitted work should be
done entirely your own. Programs should always be 100% your own work
and represent your independent thinking, and code should never be
copied from the Internet or from another student. The instructor uses
a program comparison system that compares submissions and highlights
programs that are too similar in order to detect cheating.
<P>It is expected that the class textbook will be
used as a reference, but if any other reference materials (including
web sites) are used in
preparing homework solutions they must be clearly cited.  Any
incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in
either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the
severity of the incident, and incidents will be reported to the
appropriate UNCG office.
<P><P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for everything done
or said in class (this can include changes in assignments, due dates,
etc.).  The university allows for a limited number of excused absences
for religious observances -- students who plan to take such an
absence should notify the instructor at least two weeks in advance so
that accommodations can be made (see the late work policy below).
It is the student's responsibility to obtain notes from another
student if they miss class.
<P><B>In-class Behavior:</B> When you are in class you should be
focused on the class, and you should act in a professional and mature
manner. During class there should be no eating, drinking,
e-cigarettes, cellphone use, non-class related laptop use, or anything
else that does not pertain to the class activities. Any distracting
items may be confiscated at the discretion of the instructor.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B> UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Accessibility
Resources and Services located in 215 Elliott University Center: (336)
334-5440 (or <A HREF="http://oars.uncg.edu"><CODE>http://oars.uncg.edu</CODE></A>).
<P><P><B>University Closings:</B>  If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Canvas site for information about if and how the class will
proceed. 
<P><B>Necessary Prerequisite Background:</B> To enroll in this class, you must
have made a C or better in CSC 130, CSC 230, and CSC 250. Through CSC
130 and CSC 230, you should have a fairly thorough background in basic
Java programming (both syntax and design). You should also have seen
and used some of the more advanced features of Java, and while you are
not expected to be experts in these topics yet, it is your
responsibility to review or brush up on these topics as needed. We
will use these Java features extensively in the class, and through
discussion and practice these concepts should become more and more
clear as the class progresses. Some specific advanced topics, with references to
material in the CSC 230 book (<EM>Data Structures and Abstractions
  with Java, 4th edition, by Carrano and Henry</EM>) and the book for this
class, are given below:

You should also be familiar with elementary linear data structures
from CSC 230, including arrays, lists (singly and doubly linked),
stacks, and queues, as well as recursion and algorithms for searching
and sorting. From CSC 230 and 250 you should be good at basic running
time analysis using asymptotic notation. Finally, you should know
basic discrete mathematics concepts and be able to write simple
proofs.
