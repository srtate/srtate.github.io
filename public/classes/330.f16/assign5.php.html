    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 5 - Due Thursday, November 17</H1>
    
    
    <P><B>Objective:</B> The objective of this assignment is for you to
gain experience working with the basic graph data
structure, including iterating through vertices and adjacencies. This
assignment is not as long or intricate as other full-credit
assignments, so take the time to experiment with the graph data
structure and get comfortable working with it. The time you
invest in this will pay off on the final assignment!
<P><B>Background:</B>
Courses in Computer Science depend heavily on prerequisites, and it is
common to represent prerequisites as a graph (like on the prerequisite
chart we publish on our department web page). 
It is easy to create a graph of courses linked to prerequisites by scraping
data from the <EM>UNCG Bulletin</EM>, and you can use that as input to
construct a graph with an edge from a course to each of its
prerequisites. However, sometimes we might want to look at this graph
in the other way: For each course that acts as a prerequisite, what
courses depend on it? This is the <EM>transpose</EM> of the original
graph, or the graph with the same vertices and connections, but with
the direction of each edge reversed. Your goal for this assignment is to
write methods that will allow you to take a graph of
Computer Science courses and prerequisites, and print the transpose
graph. Samples of the output for both the original graph and the
transposed graph are given below.
<P><B>What To Do:</B> Start with the code in Bitbucket, as in previous
assignments: fork the "Assign5" repository, rename it to include
your username, grant read access to the class administrators, and then
use NetBeans on your computer to clone it so you can work with
it.
<P>You are to write two methods (stubs are given in the provided code):
<UL><LI><CODE>printGraph()</CODE> prints the graph in a readable form, as
  shown in the samples below. Note that the output is
  "nice" in the sense that each vertex is followed by an
  appropriate, grammatically correct phrase on the same line,
  depending on whether there are zero, one, or more adjacent
  vertices. Note also that the vertices
  are given in sorted order -- you actually get that "for free" if
  you change one data structure that is used in the Weiss graph
  implementation. These small touches matter! 
<p><LI><CODE>getTransposedGraph()</CODE> operates on a graph and returns a
  new graph that is the transpose of the original graph (which is not
  changed).
</UL>  
<P><B>Submission Instructions:</B> Using NetBeans, commit all changes
to your project and do a "push to
upstream" to put the most up-to-date files on the Bitbucket
server. Remember: Do <EM>not</EM> create a pull request -- 
I will clone your repository (if it exists
and you granted me access) at 12:30 on the due date, and will
assume that is your submission. If you intend to keep working on your
project and submit late, please let me know by email, and I will
ignore your repository until the late submission deadline.
<P><B>Original Graph Output:</B> This shows the output of the
<CODE>printGraph()</CODE> method when called on the original graph (courses
with edges to their prerequisites).

<P><B>Transposed Graph Output:</B> 
This shows the output of the transposed graph (the graph with all edge
directions reversed). From this output, we can easily check a course
to see what later courses depend on it. Note how important this class
(CSC 330) is!
