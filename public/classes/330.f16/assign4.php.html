    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 4 - Due Tuesday, November 1</H1>
    
    <P>These are all written (non-programming) questions. Your answers are to
be turned in on paper at the beginning of class on the due date. On
all problems, <EM>show your work</EM> (describe how you arrived at the answer
-- don't just give the final answer).
<OL><LI>Page 835, Exercise 21.3
<p>  <LI>Page 836, Exercise 21.14
<p>  <LI>Page 836, Exercise 21.18
<p>  <LI>Page 342, Exercise 7.20
<p>  <LI>Draw a table and fill it in for the dynamic programming change
  making algorithm from Section 7.6 (code given in Figure 7.25),
  showing the minimum number of coins required to make change for up
  to 32 cents. Do this by hand, not by writing and running a program!
<p><LI>Page 343, Exercise 7.27
<p>  <LI>Draw a table and fill it in according to your algorithm from the
  previous problem, showing the number of ways of making change (with
  standard US coin denominations) for all values up to 32 cents.
<p><LI>Consider this problem: You need to plan a walk down an aisle
  that passes <CODE>n</CODE> stations, where each station contains an item
  labeled by its weight, and you can either pick up the item and take
  it with you, or leave it there. You want to reach the end of the
  aisle carrying some target weight (like 1 kg). At each station you
  have to make a choice (pick up the item or not), and if you make the
  wrong choice you may not discover it until you reach the end of the
  aisle (or when you're carrying too much) - when you discover your
  error, you will need to back up and try the other choice, much like
  trying to find your way through a maze. This is a
  classic backtracking approach, and the code solving this problem
  using backtracking is in Bitbucket.
<p>  <OL type="a"><LI>Analyze the worst-case running time for this algorithm (you
      will need to derive a recurrence relation and solve it).
<p>    <LI>On my workstation, a worst-case input (a list of weights for
      which there is no solution) of size 30 took 8 seconds to
      run. Estimate how long it would take to process a worst-case
      input of the following sizes: 32, 40, 50, and 60. Express your
      estimated time in whatever unit makes the most sense (seconds,
      hours, days, years, ...).
