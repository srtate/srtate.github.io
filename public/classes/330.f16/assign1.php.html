    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 1 - Due Tuesday, September 20</H1>
    
    
    <P><B>Objectives:</B> This assignment is designed with the following
objectives in mind:
<UL><LI>To give you experience with general tree implementations
<LI>To give you experience designing and implementing recursive
  algorithms on general trees
</UL>
<P><B>What To Do:</B> The base project/code for this assignment is
available through Bitbucket, as a CSC 330 team repository named
"Assign1." As in the last assignment, start by forking this
repository, renaming it to include your userid at the end, and then
granting read access to the group "ClassAdmin." Then you can clone
your forked repository in NetBeans to begin work.
<P>The goal of this project is to store information about a
tree-structured filesystem, including filenames and file sizes (in
blocks), and answer several questions about the filesystem. Included
in the main project class (named <CODE>Assign1.java</CODE>) is code to read
the tree data from a file, and a data file is provided in the project
as well. This file contains the actual data describing over 20,000 files and
directories from the <CODE>C:\WINDOWS\System32</CODE> directory on a Windows
7 computer. Once you have completed implementation of the methods for
the <CODE>Tree</CODE> and <CODE>TreeNode</CODE> classes, the provided code will be
able to read in the tree and create its internal representation in
memory for you to work with.
<P>Once you have completed the classes needed for the tree
implementation, you need to write code to answer the following three
questions:
<UL><LI>How much space does the entire filesystem take on disk?
<LI>How many files are stored in this filesystem?
<LI>Which sub-directory takes up the most space (and how much
    space)?
</UL>    
<P>Stubs (i.e., method declarations but no code) are provided for all
functions you are required to write, including <CODE>Tree</CODE> and
<CODE>TreeNode</CODE> methods and stubs for functions addressing the
three questions above (in the <CODE>Assign1.java</CODE> file). You should
fill in code for these methods, but <EM>do not change the method
  signatures at all.</EM> Your code will be tested on different data, 
using testing code that expects these method definitions to be exactly
as they are given to you!
<P><B>Submission Instructions:</B> Using NetBeans, commit all changes
to your project as you did in Assignment 0, and do a "push to
upstream" to put the most up-to-date files on the Bitbucket
server. <EM>Unlike Assignment 0, do not do a pull request!</EM>
I will clone all of your repositories (if they exist
and you granted me access) at 12:30PM on the due date, and will
assume that is your submission. If you intend to keep working on your
project and submit late, please let me know by email, and I will
ignore your repository until the late submission deadline.
