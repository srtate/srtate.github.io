    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Program Grading Guidelines</H1>
    
    
    <P>Your programs will be judged on several criteria, which are shown
below, along with examples of questions that fall under each
category. Note that while some assignments may be less demanding in
some areas (for example, if you are given an ADT to use, there's not much
question about design) the same point breakdown will be used for all
programming assignments unless stated otherwise in the assignment.
<DL><DT><B><B>Correctness (50 percent):</B></B><DD>  Does the program compile correctly?
Does the program do what it's supposed to do?
<DT><B><B>Design (20 percent):</B></B><DD> Are operations broken down into
functions and procedures in a reasonable way?  Are ADT's clearly
defined, implementation independent, and sensible? 
<DT><B><B>Style (10 percent):</B></B><DD>  Is the program indented
properly?  Do variables have meaningful names?  
<DT><B><B>Robustness (10 percent):</B></B><DD>  Does the program handle
erroneous or unexpected input/situations gracefully?
<DT><B><B>Documentation (10 percent):</B></B><DD> Do all program files begin
with a comment that identifies the author, the contents, and the
compiler used for that particular file?  Are all the procedures and
functions clearly documented using JavaDoc-style comments?  Are unclear parts
of code documented?
</DL>
<P>Notice that correctness is only half of the grade.  Design and style
are very important: you write an English paper by first laying out how
you want the information presented, then writing a rough draft that
makes all your points, and then polishing the style of that rough
draft.  Writing a program is much the same: first design how things
should be organized, then do a "rough draft" that consists of a
working implementation, and then go back and polish your code, adding
all the required comments and make sure style guidelines are followed.
Unfortunately, many people hand in their "rough draft" programs,
thinking that a working program is all they need.  If you do that in
this class, you probably will not pass.
<P>A program that does not compile will get at most 50% of the possible
points for an assignment.  If you add comments after getting your
program working, then be sure you test it again before submitting it.
It is actually fairly easy to make working code inoperable when adding
comments (by forgetting to close a comment, for example).  Even if
your program is entirely correct except for a small mistake of this
type, you will still get a maximum of 50%.
