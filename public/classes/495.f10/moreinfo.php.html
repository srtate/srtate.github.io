<h2>More Information</h2>

<p>
The definitive source for technical information on trusted computing is from the <a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/">Trusted Computing Group</a> website, where all the relevant specifications can be found.  The following links are particularly useful:
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/developers/trusted_platform_module">Trusted Platform Module documentation</a> - including TPM specifications and other documentation</li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tcg_software_stack_tss_specification">Trusted Software Stack documentation</a> - including TSS specification, architecture overview, etc.
<ul>
   <li> Latest TSS spec: <a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/files/resource_files/6479CD77-1D09-3519-AD89EAD1BC8C97F0/TSS_1_2_Errata_A-final.pdf">TCG Software Stack (TSS) Specification, Version 1.2, Errata A</a></li>

<h4>Direct Anonymous Attestation</h4>
<p>
    There are several papers that can help you understant direct anonymous attestation.  First, a good paper that gives background and basic definitions for group signatures:
    <blockquote> Guiseppe Ateniese, Jan Camenisch, Marc Joye, and Gene Tsudik.  "<a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~jca/papers/group2000.pdf">A Practical and Provably Secure Coalition-Resistant Group Signature Scheme</a>", Proceedings of CRYPTO 2000, pages 255-270.</blockquote>
			    The following paper describes a digital signature scheme that has an important property:  it is designed to support efficient protocols that deal with signatures (including zero-knowledge proofs about signatures).  This signature scheme is the basis for the DAA protocol:
    <blockquote> Jan Camenisch and Anna Lysyanskaya.  <a href="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/~jca/papers/camlys02b.pdf">A Signature Scheme with Efficient Protocols</a> (paper originally published in the 3rd International Conference on Security in Communication Networks)</blockquote>
					And last but not least is the DAA paper itself:
    <blockquote> Ernie Brickell, Jan Camenisch, and Liqun Chen.  "<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/205">Direct Anonymous Attestation</a>" (link to full version of the paper published at ACM CCS 2004)</blockquote>

<h4>Trusted Computing in Virtualization and Cloud Computing</h4>

<p>
In cloud computing, a remote computing resource is provided to a user,
and the most challenging security question is this:  How can we give the user some
assurance that the remote computing resource provides an appropriately
protected environment, safe even from attacks by a dishonest provider?
Such remote environments are typically run in virtual machines, and so
the integrity of this virtual machine environment is a very big issue in
cloud computing.  The following papers give an overview of security issues and trusted computing approaches when dealing with cloud computing and virtualization.
</p>

<p>
The following paper is from the TCG, and gives a very high-level overview of some cloud computing security issues and solutions based on trusted computing technology.  The TCG obviously wants to promote their solutions, so this reads a little like an advertisement in spots, but the section on "Critical Areas for Cloud Computing" gives some good information at a very light level.
<blockquote>
Trusted Computing Group.  "<a href="http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/cloud_computing_and_security__a_natural_match">Cloud Computing and Security -- A Natural Match</a>," TCG whitepaper, April 2010.
</blockquote>

The next paper describes sHype, a virtual machine monitor (or hypervisor), that makes use of Intel and AMD hardware virtualization support.  While that part doesn't have much to do with trusted computing, the paper does describe a very iteresting contribution:  how to virtualize TPM services (primarily discussed on page 29):
<blockquote>
R. Perez, L. van Doorn, and R. Sailer, "<a href="http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MSP.2008.135">Virtualization and Hardware-Based Security</a>," IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine, vol. 6, no. 5, pp. 24-31, 2008.
</blockquote>

The next paper is on Terra, a virtual machine based system developed at Stanford.  This is a very well-written paper, and does an excellent job of explaining how a real system was designed and built that provides the benefits of trusted computing technology in a distributed, virtualized environment.
<blockquote>
Tal Garfinkel, Ben Pfaff, Jim Chow, Mendel Rosenblum, and Dan
Boneh. "<a href="http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/abstracts/terra.html">Terra: a virtual machine-based platform for trusted
computing</a>." In Proceedings of the Nineteenth ACM Symposium on Operating
Systems Principles (SOSP), 2003, pp. 193-206.
</blockquote>

I'm including the following paper because it is fairly recent, and looks specifically at cloud computing.  I don't see how this does much more than the Terra system in the previous paper, but it's a short paper and worth reading:
<blockquote>
Nuno Santos, Krishna P. Gummadi, and Rodrigo Rodrigues.  "<a href="http://www.mpi-sws.org/~gummadi/papers/trusted_cloud.pdf">Towards
Trusted Cloud Computing</a>," Proceedings of the Workshop On Hot Topics in
Cloud Computing (HotCloud), June 2009.
