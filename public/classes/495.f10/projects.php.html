    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Project Information</H1>
    
    
    <P>As described on the class syllabus, graduate students will do a final
research-oriented project in lieu of the final exam.  From the
syllabus:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Graduate students will not have a final exam, but each graduate
student must do a research project in which they explore an area of
research (and a minimum of three research papers) and write a report
of approximately 10 pages summarizing research in that area.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the past 5 years there has been a significant amount of research in
trusted computing and other hardware-enhanced security techniques, and
this should be the basis of your project and report.  The three
research papers you choose should be peer-reviewed research papers --
not web pages or product documentation or anything like that.  At
least two papers should be specifically about trusted computing, but
the third could be a general research background paper.  For example,
if you wanted to do a project on Private Information Retrieval, one
paper could be one of the initial papers (from the early to mid
1990's) that describes the problem and solutions that pre-date trusted
computing.
<P>The
project will have various "milestones," with the following due dates:
<DL><DT><B><I>Project topic selection:</I></B><DD>  Monday, November 15
<DT><B><I>References selected and paper outline:</I></B><DD>
  Monday, November 22
<DT><B><I>Draft submitted for feedback (optional):</I></B><DD>
  Friday, December 3
<DT><B><I>Final report due:</I></B><DD> Friday, December
  10 (7:00 PM)
</DL>
You should email the final report to me by the due date -- please
email me a PDF (not a DOC or other format).
<P>What follows are some possible project topics.  This is by no means an
exhaustive list, and you should feel free to look for other topics and
to browse research literature for other topics that interest you.
(<I>Note: The printed version of this handout gives bibliographic
  references that allow you to find the paper with a little bit of
  work -- the online version of this handout has links to these
  papers when possible, although for some links you need to be on the
  UNCG campus so that you can use the library's subscription to these
  publications.</I>)
<H2><A NAME="1">Other hardware-enhanced security architectures</A></H2>
<P>Trusted computing technology, as defined by the Trusted Computing
Group, is not the only way to enhance security through hardware
additions or modifications.  Surveying some alternative approaches,
highlighting strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, could
be an interesting project.  Some of the papers you might consider are
the following:

<H2><A NAME="2">Private Information Retrieval</A></H2>
<P>Consider a data provider that allows you to make queries against the
data it holds, but the user would like to make queries in a private
manner so that the server cannot tell exactly what data has been
retrieved.  For example, you could have a medical database that
patients could query, but patient queries have full privacy.  At first
this seems to be impossible (or at least very difficult), but trusted
hardware provides some interesting possibilities.  Some of the work in
this area is in the following papers:

<H2><A NAME="3">Grid or cloud computing or virtualization</A></H2>
<P>Using computing resources across the Internet is a hot topic these
days, whether it is to increase the computing power available by
aggregating computing resources together (grid computing) or simply
making use of hardware managed remotely (cloud computing).  There are
clearly some interesting security and privacy issues when your
computing resources are not under your control, and trusted computing
technology can be used to increase security and privacy in such a
situation.  Some papers along these lines are the following:

  Sailer, and Leendert van Doorn.

<H2><A NAME="4">Attestation issues</A></H2>
<P>Attestation, or proving that a system is running particular software
or has particular properties, is a very important feature of trusted
computing.  As we discussed in class, using secure boot and a static
root of trust leads to a highly complex system.  Chipset and processor
support for a dynamic root of trust is one solution, but there are
other interpretations (sometimes built on a dynamic root of trust) of
attestation that are interesting to consider.  The following papers
are examples of work in this area:
<UL><LI>Fabrizio Baiardi, Diego Cilea, Daniele Sgandurra, and Francesco Ceccarelli.
