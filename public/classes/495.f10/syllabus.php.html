<P><P>BRIEF DESCRIPTION: Introduction to trusted computing concepts with an
emphasis on practical programming exercises.  Graduate students
(registered for CSC 680) will also gain experience with current
research in trusted computing.
<P><P>STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to
<UL><LI>explain concepts of trusted computing, including variations
  created by the Trusted Computing Group, Microsoft, and Intel;
<LI>perform key management and other tasks using a TPM;
<LI>apply trusted computing concepts to design simple applications;
<LI>evaluate trusted computing solutions to security problems;
<LI><I>For Graduate Students:</I> discuss current research issues in trusted computing.
</UL>
<P>TEACHING METHODS AND ASSIGNMENTS FOR ACHIEVING LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
This class is organized around standard 75-minute lectures, with
students responsible for completing assigned readings before class.
Assignments will
require students to apply and reflect upon covered concepts -- the
majority of assignments will be programming exercises, but some
written exercises will be required so students reflect on what they
have learned.  <EM>Graduate students</EM> registered in CSC 680 will
also be given 4-5 research papers during the semester, which they are
responsible for reading and writing short summaries about.  Graduate
students are expected to be able to understand and concisely pull out
the "key ideas" from these research papers, and will give brief
presentations to the class so that undergraduates are also exposed to
current research.
<P>There will be a midterm exam which covers fundamental trusted
computing concepts.  There will be a final exam for undergraduates,
but undergraduates have the option of doing an individual project in
lieu of the exam.  Graduate students will not have a final exam, but
each graduate student must do a research project in which they explore
an area of research (and a minimum of three research papers) and write
a report of approximately 10 pages summarizing research in that area.
<P><P>EVALUATION AND GRADING:  Each student activity will contribute to the
final grade in the class according to the following percentages.

<P><P>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY:
Students are expected to 
abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online
at 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>
<P>Graduate students will be reviewing and summarizing current research
throughout the course.  Issues of scientific attribution and
plagiarism will be discussed in class and students are expected to
follow appropriate practices in this regard.
<P>Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do.  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."
<P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY:  Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for
everything done or said in class (this can include changes in
assignments, due dates, etc.).  The university allows for a limited
number of excused absences for religious observances -- students who
plan to take such an absence should notify the instructor at least two
weeks in advance so that accommodations can be made (also see the late
work policy at the end of this syllabus).
It is the student's responsibility to
obtain notes from another student if they miss class.
<P><P>REQUIRED TEXTS/READING/REFERENCES:
The following book is required, and covers the basics of trusted
computing and some applications:
<UL><LI>D. Challener, K. Yoder, R. Catherman, D. Safford, and L. van
  Doorn.  <EM>A Practical Guide to Trusted Computing</EM>, IBM Press, 2008.
</UL>
Additional readings will be distributed in class.
<P><P>TOPICS:  The following is a rough outline of topics covered in this
class, where the numbers in parentheses indicate the approximate
number of 75-minute lectures devoted to this topic.  As this is the
first time this course has been offered, the schedule is flexible and
may be adjusted based on class progress and student interest.

<P>The midterm will be scheduled after all fundamental material has been
covered (roughly Chapters 1-9 in the book), and the date will be
announced in class at least two weeks before the midterm.
<P><P>FINAL EXAMINATION:
As described above, undergraduate students have the option of either
taking a final exam or completing a final project, and graduate
students will complete a research project.  Undergraduates opting for
the final exam will take the exam at the regularly scheduled exam
time, and students doing projects must turn in their final project by
the beginning of the final exam time.
<P>Final exam/projects due:  Friday, December 10, 7:00 PM
<P>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES:
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Laptops can be both a benefit and a distraction in a classroom.  While
many students benefit from taking notes using a laptop, or having
access to outside class-related resources during class, other students
cannot resist the temptation of checking e-mail, chatting, or even
playing games during class time.  This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, and may
be turned in up to 7 calendars days late with a 25% late penalty.
Students with planned absences, whether for university events,
religious observance, or other reason, are expected to make
arrangements with the instructor to turn in assignments or take exams
before the scheduled date of the assignment or test.
<EM>No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after
  the original due date!</EM>
<P>The mid-term can be made up only if it was missed due to a significant
emergency, and arrangements must be made <EM>before</EM> the scheduled
midterm.  The final exam or project paper is due at the
university-scheduled final exam date and time, and will not be
accepted late.
<P><P>ADA STATEMENT:  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
