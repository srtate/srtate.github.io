<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Review Sheet for Final</H1>
    

<P><P><P>The final exam in this class will be Wednesday, December 7, from 3:30
- 6:30 (it will be designed for 90 minutes, but you will have the
entire three hours if you'd like it).  The exam will focus primarily
on material covered since the last exam, but will include questions
from material covered on the first two exams, as well as questions
which try to pull everything together.  Make sure you review the
terminology that was introduced in these chapters (terms are given at
the end of each chapter).
<P>Earlier exams provided pretty thorough coverage of Chapters 1 - 9.
The following is a list of the main topics we have covered since the
last exam:
<UL><LI>Sections 10.1-10.2 (Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal)
<LI>Chapter 11 (Cryptographic Hash Functions)
<LI>Sections 12.1-12.5 (MACs and HMAC)
<LI>Chapter 13 (Digital Signatures)
<LI>Chapter 14 (Key Management and Distribution)
<LI>Basics of network/IP protocols and controls (firewall and
  intrusion detection concepts and terminology)
</UL>
<P>The final exam will be similar to earlier exams, except that there
will be more problems to work out, including one "challenge"
question that requires you to think more creatively about the topics
we have covered.  For this question you will have at least 2
alternative questions, and you only need to solve one of them.  Here's
a sample "challenge question":
<UL><LI>The country of Oceania has decided to outlaw encryption but to allow
integrity-protecting technologies such as hash functions and digital
signatures.  Since the policy-makers know that hash functions are
"one-way", they figure people can't use them for encryption.
However, any secure hash function can be turned into a secure
symmetric cipher.  Devise a way to do this.  Some answers are better
than others, but I don't expect perfection here -- you simply need to
have a reasonable approach:  describe why you think your particular
technique is secure.
</UL>
<P>On the back of this page are samples of the more standard exam questions.
<UL><LI>What are the requirements of a cryptographic hash function (hint: the
book listed 6 properties)?  Give a brief (one
sentence) description of each.
<LI>Both MACs and digital signature schemes are designed with the goal of
being resistant to "existential forgery."  Describe what this means
and why this is an important property.
<LI>What is a certificate and what role does it play in the distribution
of public keys?  Describe what a certificate does, what it protects
against, and how it does this.
<LI>Give three different types of firewall, with a brief description of
each.  Make sure it's clear how the different types are actually
different.
</UL>
