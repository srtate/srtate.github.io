    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Project Information and Possible Topics</H1>
    
    
    <P><P>The purpose of this handout is to give some information on project
guidelines and deadlines, as well as list some possible project
topics.  Projects will generally be individual projects, but if an
innovative and involved project is proposed, then with permission of
the instructor a small team (2 or 3 people) may work on a project.
Projects require a final written report on the chosen topic and people
are encouraged to include at least some hands-on component.  Here are
the parts and milestones for the project:
<DL><DT><B>Project Selection (Due Monday, November 14):</B><DD> You should look
over the potential project topics below, do some initial reading to
see what you find interesting and what you can get sufficient material
for.  Keep in mind the topic criteria below.  All I need on November 14
is a project topic/title, but if you want to give me more information
about what you plan on investigating I will give you feedback on that.
<p>
<DT><B>Progress Report (Due Wednesday, November 30):</B><DD> By the time of the
progress report your project should be pretty well investigated,
meaning you've collected and read all of the reference papers, and
thought through what you're going to write about in your report.  You
should turn in a progress report that contains <EM>a basic introduction
section to your project report (this should describe the topic you're
studying at a high level and describe what you will be giving giving
details on), as well as an outline of your report and a list of
bibliographic references that you plan on using</EM>. For group project
teams, also include a plan of who will perform what specific
activities.
<P>It is very important that you use an acceptable format for your
references.  All references must include the following: Authors, paper
title, where it appeared, date (just the year is good enough), and
page numbers.  For journal papers, also include volume and issue
number information.  Here are two sample formatted references (one
conference and one journal) -- please follow this format as closely
as you can!
<UL><LI>[[1]] J. Li, M. Sung, J. Xu, and L. Li.  "Large-Scale IP
  Traceback in High-Speed Internet:  Practical Techniques and
  Theoretical Foundation," <EM>Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on
  Security and Privacy</EM>, pp. 115-129, 2004.
<LI>[[2]] L. Buttyan, J. Hubaux, and S. Capkun, "A
  Formal Model of Rational Exchange and Its Application to the
  Analysis of Syverson's Protocol," <EM>Journal of Computer
  Security</EM>, Vol.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;3/4, pp. 551-588, 2004.
</UL>
The progress report is graded, and counts for 25% of your overall
project grade.  However, the most important part of the progress
report is that I will review it and make comments and suggestions that
I will give back to you on Friday, December 2.  This is where I tell
you if you are going in the right direction, and give suggestions for
things you should include for a good final report.  Note that this
only gives you 5 days to respond to my comments or suggestions in
preparing the final report --
<EM>if you would like more time for responding to comments, you can
  turn in your progress report at any time before the due date, and I
  will get feedback to you as soon as I can.</EM>
<p>
<DT><B>Complete Project (Due Wednesday, December 7, at the final exam):</B><DD>
This is when the full report is due.
</DL>
<P><B>Topic/Depth Guidelines:</B>
This is intended to be a <EM>research</EM> oriented project, not a
technology description.  A topic which describes a product or system 
but without any significant underlying question is not appropriate.
For instance, a report on IPsec isn't appropriate, but a report on how
security protocols are analyzed using IPsec as an example would be good.
<P>For any topic, multiple references should be used -- no project
should depend on a single reference source.  At least two references
should be "respectable references" (peer-reviewed journal or
conference papers -- not Joe Schmo's web page).
<P>Keep in mind that this is a computer science class, and technical
depth is important.  Formulas, theorems, proofs, and analysis are
certainly important and should be included as appropriate.  Since this
is a research topic, it's also important to think about (and write
about) what questions are left unanswered by the current research that
should be investigated ("open problems").  As for the length of the
paper, something around 10 pages (11 or 12 point font,
single spaced) should be about the right.
<P>Remember that the writing should be entirely your own -- it is not
acceptable to copy text from a paper or the web.  My general advice to
people is this:  Investigate and read as much about the topic as you
can until you really understand it, taking some light notes.  Then you
should know the topic well enough to put aside all your references,
and do the writing <EM>without looking</EM> at the original material.
That ensures that the writing is coming from <EM>you</EM> and not the
reference material.
<H2><A NAME="1">Possible Topics</A></H2>
<P>The following topics are simply suggestions.  If you know of some
other topic you'd like to investigate for your project, talk to me
about it -- if it's of a sufficient level and appropriately relevant
to the topics of this class, then I'll probably approve it.  However,
note that it should be research-oriented (in
other words, it should be addressing a question, not summarizing a
product or technology).  If one of these topics intrigues you, but
you're not sure where to start looking, just ask and I'll give you
some pointers.
<UL><LI>SHA-3 candidates, properties, strengths and weaknesses
<LI>Authentication and federated identity protocols (Shibboleth,
  OpenID, etc.)
<LI>Cryptographic hardware devices
<LI>Cryptographic techniques for digital rights management (DRM),
such as digital watermarking, application in SDMI, etc.
<LI>Cloud computing issues: outsourced storage and computation
<LI>Practice-Oriented Provable Security
<LI>Provable security techniques (model checking, spi-calculus, etc.)
<LI>Electronic voting/election protocols (cryptographic techniques)
<LI>Privacy, anonymous publishing, and anonymous communication (Tor,
  remailer, ...)
<LI>Security protocols for peer-to-peer networks
<LI>Factoring and discrete logarithm algorithms (for the
mathematically adventurous!)
<LI>Cryptanalysis
<LI>Side-channel attacks
<LI>Cryptography for embedded devices or sensor networks
<LI>Contracting protocols (fair exchange, etc.)
<LI>Digital Cash
<LI>Alternative signature schemes (threshold signatures, undeniable
signatures, group signatures, ...)
<LI>Quantum cryptography or computing issues: key exchange or factoring
</UL>
<P><P>The following are some of the leading security conferences, and provide
excellent material (there are, of course, other good quality conferences
and journals, but these are the best place to start).
