    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 4 - Due Friday, October 14</H1>
    
    
    <P>The first two problems are from the book, and deal with error
propagation in two block cipher modes.
<OL><LI>Page 216, Problem 6.4
<LI>Page 216, Problem 6.8
</OL>
<P>The remaining problems explore the security models that we discussed
in class, in particular the notion of indistinguishability under
chosen plaintext attack.  First, let's review the ideas and define
some notation.
<P>We define security in terms of a "game" that an adversary plays
against "oracles" -- if you can define an adversary that wins the
game with probability significantly better than making a random guess,
then the scheme is insecure.  Conversely, if no adversary can win the
game with probability non-negligibly higher than guessing then the
scheme is secure.  Note that it's much easier to prove a scheme is
insecure than to prove that one is secure!
<P>The "IND-CPA game" is as
follows.  At the beginning of the game the oracle(s) randomly choose a
key for the encryption scheme that is being attacked.  During the
game, there are two oracles that the adversary can interact with,
called <TT>Encrypt</TT> and <TT>Challenge</TT>.  If the adversary
calls <TT>Encrypt</TT><I>(M)</I> for some message <I>M</I>, the oracle encrypts
<I>M</I> using the key that it selected at the beginning of the game and
returns the ciphertext.  The other oracle takes two plaintext inputs,
chosen however the adversary wants, and is called by
<TT>Challenge</TT><I>(M<sub>0</sub>,M<sub>1</sub>)</I>.  The <TT>Challenge</TT> oracle picks a
random bit <I>b in {0,1}</I> and returns <TT>Encrypt</TT><I>(M<sub>b</sub>)</I> without
letting the adversary know what <I>b</I> was chosen.  Note that
<TT>Challenge</TT> can only be called once for the duration of the
game.  At the end of the
game, the adversary must guess the value of <I>b</I> (in other words, which
plaintext did the <TT>Challenge</TT> oracle encrypt?) -- if the
adversary is correct, than it wins the game.  Clearly it's easy to
make an adversary that wins with probability <I>(1)/(2)</I> just by
guessing randomly, so the challenge is to win with probability
significantly greater than <I>(1)/(2)</I>.  In all of the problems
below, the adversary can win every time (i.e., it wins with
probability 1).
<OL><LI>A <EM>deterministic</EM> encryption scheme is one that produces
  the same ciphertext every time the same plaintext is encrypted.
  Prove that a deterministic encryption scheme cannot be IND-CPA
  secure.  More specifically, carefully and precisely define an
  adversary algorithm that wins the IND-CPA game against any
  deterministic encryption scheme.  Define the adversary using pseudo
  code, and make sure you give your reasoning describing why this wins
  the IND-CPA game.
<LI>It turns out that ECB mode is horribly insecure with respect to
  the IND-CPA game.  Devise an adversary that can win the IND-CPA game
  against an ECB mode scheme by only using a single call to the
  <TT>Challenge</TT> oracle, and never calling the 
  <TT>Encrypt</TT> oracle.
<LI>When we talked about CBC mode, we stressed that the IV should be
  unpredictable.  What if this is not the case?  Consider an
  encryption scheme that uses CBC mode with a standard deterministic
  block cipher so that encryption of a message <I>M</I> produces a
  ciphertext of the form <I> &lt; IV,C &gt; </I>, where <I>IV</I> is the
  initialization vector for CBC mode encryption of <I>M</I>.  Now assume
  that we have some function <TT>Predict</TT><I>(IV)</I> that computes
  <I>IV'</I> with the following property:  if a call to <TT>Encrypt</TT>
  produces <I> &lt; IV,C &gt; </I> then the next call to
  <TT>Encrypt</TT> will produce a ciphertext of the form <I> &lt; IV',C' &gt; </I> (for example, if we used a counter for the IVs, then
  we could predict the next IV).  Show that if this is the case then the
  scheme is not IND-CPA secure -- again define the adversary
  carefully, but in this case you can call <TT>Encrypt</TT> in
  addition to the oracles.
