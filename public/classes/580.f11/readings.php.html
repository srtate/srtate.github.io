    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Paper Review Reports</H1>
    
    
    <P>Throughout this course you will be given current research papers to
read and review.  In general, you will be given 2 weeks to read these
papers and consider the results, and write a 1 page summary of each
paper.
<P><P>In your review, you should (briefly!) address the following issues:
<UL><LI>What is the paper's main result and contribution?
<LI>Does the paper sufficiently support the conclusions?
<LI>What new did you learn from this paper?
<LI>What problems or questions are left unsolved ("open problems")?
<LI>Are there additional directions for related future research that
  you can think of?
<LI>Identify a paper or two that would allow an interested person to
  explore this topic further (these can either be key references from
  the paper itself, or can be results of searches through research
  databases or the web).
</UL>
In your review, remember that everything you write should be your own
words -- don't copy any text (including conclusions) from the paper.
