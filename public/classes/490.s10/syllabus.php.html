<P><P>CATALOG DESCRIPTION:  Application of classroom knowledge and skills in
computer science to solve real-world problems and to develop research
and development skills.
<P><P><P>STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Upon successful completion of this course students will have
demonstrated an ability to
<OL><LI>(<EM>Knowledge, Comprehension</EM>) identify project/research

  tools necessary for computer science practices relevant to the
  project they undertake; use techniques in recent research papers to
  solve problems.
</OL>
<P>TEACHING METHODS AND ASSIGNMENTS FOR ACHIEVING LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
This class will meet twice per week for 75 minutes each meeting --
some class time will be traditional lectures, reviewing concepts and
tools that are useful for the senior project, but most class time will
be used for guided discussion, student presentations, and some team
meetings.  
<P>Students are expected to work in teams of 2-4 students and choose an
appropriate project/research topic in consultation with the
instructor.  Teams then do a short presentation that "pitches" the
idea to the instructor and the class.  While there is some flexibility
in project selection, students should keep in mind the "capstone"
nature of this class.  Projects should demonstrate that the students
have a working knowledge of basic and advanced concepts in computer
science and also demonstrate a reasonable knowledge of recent
developments in computer science. <EM>Each project should include
  non-trivial software development that has been approved by the
  instructor.</EM>
<P>With an approved project, students will proceed through a standard
sequence of software development stages, beginning with a requirements
analysis and specification, and concluding with a final evaluation.  A
full list of the 5 project stages is given in the "TOPICAL
OUTLINE/CALENDAR" section.  At the end of each stage, each team must
produce a written report giving stage-specific documentation and
describing the work performed, problems encountered, and decisions
made.  Each report must include a brief meeting log and
breakdown of tasks by team member.  One week before the completion of
each stage, there will be a presentation from each project that
previews the progress and results in that phase, for in-class
discussion and suggestions for refinement in the following week.  For
these intermediate stage presentations, team members will rotate
through as "presenter" for the team, and each student must make at
least two intermediate-stage presentations (for teams with 3 or 4
people this 
means that there will have to be multiple presentations on the same
stage).
<P>The final deliverables for the project are: a <EM>technical report</EM>
that includes a self-contained one page summary, suitable for putting
on a web page, a <EM>display poster</EM>, and an <EM>oral
  presentation</EM>.  For projects that aim to develop a usable software
system, the technical report must include a "user's manual" that
describes the system to an end-user.  In addition to the team's
project report, each member should individually turn in a short summary
of their own contributions and their own thoughts on
teamwork aspects of the project (specific guidelines will be
provided).
The final presentation should be a coordinated presentation in which
each team member speaks for at least 5 minutes on some aspect of the
project, highlighting their individual contributions toward the
project's success.
<P><P>EVALUATION AND GRADING: Students work on a single project throughout
the duration of this course, and their course grade is calculated
based on the grades for individual aspects and milestones.  The
project will be graded for content, correctness, quality of
presentation (oral and written reports), team work,
and the demonstration of the student's knowledge in the
computer science field.

<P><I>ETS Exam:</I> You must take the ETS exam (a standardized test of
undergraduate-level computer science knowledge) to pass this
course. However the scores that you receive for the ETS exam will not affect
your grade in this course. The Department of Computer Science will pay
the fee for the ETS exam, which will be given on <EM>Thursday,
  March 25</EM>.  Note that the ETS exam takes longer than the 75 minutes
allocated for this class -- the exact times will be
determined later to be compatible with student schedules.
<P><P>REQUIRED TEXTS/READING/REFERENCES:
Readings and references are project-specific, and will be determined
by project groups, with approval of the instructor.
<P>TOPICAL OUTLINE/CALENDAR:
<P>
<P>See <A HREF="syllabus.pdf">PDF version</A>.

<P><P>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY:
Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do.  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."  For information on the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy,
see
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>. 
<P>Students are encouraged and expected to work in teams, but individual
responsibilities should be planned and documented throughout the
phases of the project.
<P>Students will be making extensive use of external references for their
project, and should be vigilant in maintaining high standards with
regard to attribution and avoidance of plagiarism.  If there are
questions about how to deal with any such matters, the student should
discuss the matter with the instructor to make sure there are no
misunderstandings. 
<P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY:
Attendance is vital for this class, since discussions and regular oral
presentations and progress reports will have a strong impact on the
ability to complete the project.  You may be dropped from the course
for missing more than two meetings.
<P><P>FINAL EXAMINATION:
There will be no final examination in this class.  Final project
reports are due on the last day of class before finals week.
<P><P>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Laptops can be both a benefit and a distraction in a classroom.  While
many students benefit from taking notes using a laptop, or having
access to outside class-related resources during class, other students
cannot resist the temptation of checking e-mail, chatting, or even
playing games during class time.  This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Late work will not be accepted.  Make arrangements with the instructor
to turn in work <EM>early</EM> if you will not be in class on the due
date.
<P><P>ADA STATEMENT:  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
