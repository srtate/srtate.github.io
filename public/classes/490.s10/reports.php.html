<h3>CSC 490 Project Report Guidelines</h3>

<P><P><P>This handout describes what is expected in each stage of your final
project.  Each major project stage includes a presentation and a
report from each team.  I care about concise, precise, and complete
communication, with an emphasis on logical organization.  Your
decisions in one stage of the project should be easily understood and
unambiguous, so that when you move into the next stage you have a
clear agenda.  I do care about proper grammar and spelling, but don't
care about wordy, "pretty" language -- be utilitarian and clear.
<P>When creating your presentation, you should aim for approximately 20
minutes.  Make sure you have a good, logical structure.  The best
presentations are "modular" in that they have several small,
self-contained pieces that are related to each other in clear ways.
The worst presentations are stream-of-consciousness brain dumps
without any structure.  For some guidance on criteria to consider in
your presentation, see the peer review form categories.
<P>There are no fixed length requirements for reports, formatting or font
requirements.  The presentation must be
formatted so that it's easy to extract and understand the
necessary information, but there are no requirements beyond that.
If you have any questions, or would like recommendations, I'm happy to
work through ideas with you.
<P>Here are some things to keep in mind throughout all stages of the
project: First, one purpose of the senior project is to show that you
can balance choices and make good decisions.  This means that you
should be documenting alternatives that you consider, and why you made
the choices you made.  It's tempting just to simply report on what you
put into your project, but that's not enough here -- you also need to
report on what you <EM>didn't</EM> put in your project (within reason,
of course)!  You should also keep a meeting log or journal of team
meetings and decisions made.  This doesn't need to be as formal as
keeping meeting "minutes," but should document when you met, what
items you discussed, and what decisions you made.
<H1><A NAME="1">Project Topic Proposal (the "Pitch")</A></H1>
<DL><DT><B><I>Concise description.</I></B><DD> Give your project a <EM>name</EM>
  and be able to describe the basic idea in just one or two sentences.
<DT><B><I>Background.</I></B><DD>  Briefly describe anything that your
  project depends on that isn't common knowledge.  For example, if
  your project is related to an existing game, describe the basics of
  that game.
<DT><B><I>More details.</I></B><DD> Next, flesh out your description a
  little.  Give a high level description of your proposed
  solution -- providing a basic screen layout describing how a user
  might work with the system would be very beneficial.
<DT><B><I>Feasibility and challenges.</I></B><DD>  Describe what skills you
  think will be necessary to complete the project, such as knowledge
  of networking, databases, web development, etc.  What skills does
  your team have and what will you need to learn?  Do you foresee any
  particular challenges?
<DT><B><I>Incremental development.</I></B><DD>  It's good to be ambitious,
  but you need to make sure you get something finished.  What is the
  "baseline" project that you absolutely know you can get working?
  How will you prioritize features to add beyond this baseline?  Does
  your project allow for a "plugin" style development where features
  can be added somewhat independently of the core project?
<DT><B><I>Team management.</I></B><DD>  Describe how your team will
  interact.  Will you have regular meetings?  How will decisions be
  made?  You don't have to have a lot of details here, but should have
  thought a little about how you will work together.
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="2">Report 1:  Requirements/Specification</A></H1>
<P>This report focuses on the user experience -- you should
describe <EM>what</EM> your system should do, but not really worry about
<EM>how</EM> it's going to do it.  Of course, you need to keep in the
back of your mind what is feasible and what isn't, but you don't need
to worry about internal data representations, algorithms, or anything
like that yet.
<DL><DT><B><I>System profile and requirements.</I></B><DD>  Describe the
  computer requirements for your project.  Will it run on a server?  A
  desktop machine?  A mobile device?  You should consider these
  components:  processing, memory and secondary storage requirements,
  and network use.  Are there any special requirements for any of
  these?  For example, some projects may require a lot of
  communication, so require a fast network.  Some projects
  might need specialized hardware -- if that's the case, you need to
  describe fairly fully what is required.
<DT><B><I>Use cases.</I></B><DD>  Use cases describe how a user performs
  major tasks using your system.  Each use case should come from a
  situation in which you say "The user wants to do X" -- this is
  the <EM>Goal</EM> of the use case.  In addition to the goal, each use
  case should include a clearly marked definition of <EM>Actors</EM>
  (who is involved, if multiple users) and a <EM>Sequence of
    Events</EM>.  The sequence can be described using a list, a flowchart,
  UML, or even something like pseudocode -- it's <EM>not</EM>
  describing an algorithm your system uses, but rather it's describing
  what the user is doing to accomplish this task.  Other things that
  are suitable in certain use cases are <EM>Preconditions</EM>,
  <EM>Postconditions</EM>, and <EM>Triggers</EM> (what causes a use case
  to begin).  You should have a use case defined for every major type
  of task the user is able to do in your system.
<P>  Use cases describe how the user interacts with
  the system, and so screen designs and other user interface
  components should be described here.  You should also consider
  whether there are different <EM>classes</EM> of users -- for example,
  in some systems there might be authenticated users (i.e., logged in
  users), guest users, superusers, etc.  If use cases vary
  considerably for different classes of users, be sure to include this
  information.
<DT><B><I>Questions to be answered.</I></B><DD>  As you sketch out what you
  want your system to do, you'll probably think of questions that
  you'll need to answer as you develop the design of your system.  For
  example, will you keep all your data in memory, or work out of a
  database?  These questions don't need answers now, but you should
  document these questions here.
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="3">Report 2:  Planning and Analysis</A></H1>
<P>The last stage was user-centric, describing how the user would
interact with your system.  This stage is system-centric:
describe how information is modeled and represented in your system,
how it is processed, and what tools you will use in building your
system.
<DL><DT><B><I>Preliminary object/process model.</I></B><DD>  This report should
  contain definitions of the data types that you will use in your
  system, using standard representations.  For example, if you use an
  object-oriented design for your system, use standard UML diagrams to
  describe classes and relations between classes.  If you use a
  relational database, produce an entity-relationship diagram that
  describes tables and relations.  Information about these
  representations and some tools to help you are available from the
  class web page.
<P>  For a process model, describe how information flows through your
  system and is processed for at least some of the use cases you
  defined in the previous report.  You should think about places where
  you have to identify a specific data structure or algorithm, or make
  other design decisions.
<DT><B><I>System and algorithm analysis.</I></B><DD>  As you develop the
  process model, you will identify places where significant
  computations are performed.  By "significant," I mean anything
  that's not just doing some assignments and copying data around.
  This could be as simple as sorting some data or as complex as
  optimizing parameters of a complex system.  In most cases there are
  multiple solutions for these computational problems -- describe
  some alternatives, give the pros and cons of each as well as you can
  (use proper computer science reasoning that you've learned in your
  courses, such as asymptotic time analysis).  If you can make a
  decision at this point, describe how you made that decision based on
  the pros and cons (and potentially other issues like the amount of
  data involved).  If you cannot make a decision at this point,
  describe how you will make this decision -- will you code multiple
  algorithms and see which on works best?  Do a more in-depth analysis?
  Just like in the initial design, you are encouraged to prioritize
  here:  you can select an algorithm that you know will
  get the job done, while giving a lower priority to later testing
  and replacement with a more efficient algorithm.  Your design must
  be modular enough to accomplish this though!
<DT><B><I>Tool selection.</I></B><DD>  At this point you should have a
  fairly well-defined project, and you need to select what tools you
  will use.  This means deciding things like a language, development
  environment, database server or package, and third-party libraries.
  It is important not to re-invent the wheel!  If you are using
  standard data structures, use the ones provided with the language
  you're working with.  If you need some standard math operations then
  look to see what's available (linear algebra packages, etc.).  There
  are some excellent graphics and user interface libraries out there
  -- do a little research and find one that is a good match for your
  system and your other tool choices.  It is likely that in some cases
  there are multiple options to choose between, so pick one or two
  places where you had to make a decision and describe the process you
  used to make that decision.  List the pros and cons for each option,
  which could address things like stability/quality of the tool,
  performance (you could run tests), usability, reviews by other
  people, etc.  Finally, describe what considerations you used in
  making your choice.
<P>  There is one tool that everyone is required to use:  You will use
  the Subversion (SVN) revision control system, with the repository on a
  department server.  We will discuss how to work with SVN at
  an appropriate time, but all of your code that you turn in will be
  submitted by checking it in to SVN.  You are encouraged to use it
  regularly in order to coordinate code development with your
  teammate(s).
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="4">Report 3:  System/Research Design</A></H1>
<P>In this stage, you move beyond planning and design, and into
constructing parts of your system.  At this point you will be
primarily defining your data types and constructing initial
databases.  You should take your object/data models from the previous
stage and turn those into actual programming language definitions
(e.g., a Java class) or SQL definitions (for example, a MySQL script
that does "CREATE TABLE" commands).
<DL><DT><B><I>Amended models.</I></B><DD>  Once you start realizing your
  object/data model, it is often the case that you discover things
  that need to be added or changed.  Any updates to the models defined
  earlier should be reported here.  Note that changes to your model
  reflect decisions that you've made -- explain clearly why you
  decided to make this change (what problem is it correcting, and what
  would have happened if you didn't make the change).
<DT><B><I>Detailed designs and controls.</I></B><DD>  The code that defines
  your objects, or the SQL statements that create your databases,
  contain all the precise information about your data types and
  representations. You should make sure to check in all code to this
  point, including the code that defines/creates your data
  types.  You don't need to turn in a complete printout of this, but
  might include parts in your report to help illustrate particular
  changes you had to make (in describing "Amended models").
<DT><B><I>Test plan.</I></B><DD>  The test plan is one of the most important
  parts of this stage.  This should very carefully describe tests that
  you will perform on your system, including details such as where the
  testing data comes from: is it a constructed data set, or a randomly
  generated data set, or what?  You should have both unit test cases
  (testing a particular class, for example) and integration testing
  (testing how the units work together).  Keep in mind the use cases you
  defined earlier, and make sure your tests can support the claim that
  your system is achieving the goals defined in each use case.  Your
  test cases should also include extremes and even invalid data to
  check border cases.  You are encouraged to use a code coverage tool
  in performing tests, but if you can justify that your test cases are
  thorough and complete without such a tool you can do that as well.
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="5">Report 4:  Implementation and Testing</A></H1>
<P>The presentation for this phase is a little different -- rather than
a summary of the report you'll turn in, this presentation should be a
"code walkthrough."  You won't have time to go through all the code
you've developed, so first give a high-level overview of how your code
is structured, and then pick a part that you think is particularly
interesting (because it solves a challenging problem, for example),
and go through that code more carefully.  If there are places where
you're stuck or would like help, this is a good place to seek help
from your classmates.
<DL><DT><B><I>Source code.</I></B><DD>  You don't need to turn in a printout of
  your source code, but you need to make sure that everything is
  checked into the SVN repository -- this includes all
  the code you've developed, including tools or scripts to set up
  databases or perform tests.
<DT><B><I>Test results and discussion.</I></B><DD>  The only 
  hardcopy report that you'll turn in gives the results of the test
  cases.  Remember the test cases you defined in Report 3?  You should
  execute those plans now!  For each test, did you get the answer you
  expected?  Is there anything that might need extra work?
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="6">Final Poster</A></H1>
<P>Your final poster should describe your project in a visually pleasing
way at a high level.  These will be printed to be approximately 3 feet
by 4 feet, and a template is supplied for you to use.  Posters should
use lots of figures, diagrams, and pictures, and be relatively light
on text -- a lot like a good power point presentation, but in a
different format.
<P>At the top of the poster you must put a title describing your project
and the names of the students on the project team.  The first thing
people should see after the title is a concise and clear description
of the problem you are trying to solve.  Then a separate block should
describe your solution -- just focus on the big ideas at this point.
Including screenshots to show how the user interacts with your system
is very beneficial here!
<P>The rest of the poster varies depending on project and what's
interesting in the project.  Is there a design component that was
particularly interesting?  If your project has a computationally
intensive part where selection of an algorithm was important, explain
that.  If you deal with a lot of data, explain how it is structured,
stored, and used.  If there is an emphasis on user interaction,
describe the choices you made for the user interface.  In each of
these cases, it would be good to briefly describe why you made the
decisions that you made:  Did you test multiple algorithms?  Did you
run a usability test?  At the end of this part, you should include
some statistics or metrics:  How many lines of code did you write?
How large is your database?  Is anyone actually using your system yet?
Place yourself in the position of a technical person learning about
your project for the first time -- does your poster answer the
questions you'd be most likely to ask?
<P>As a final part of the poster, you could include thoughts on future
directions -- in other words, if this project were to continue, what
would you want to do next?  Add additional features?  Tune
performance?  Improve the interface?
<H1><A NAME="7">Final Presentation and Report</A></H1>
<P>The final presentation should be a coordinated presentation in which
each team member speaks for roughly the same amount of time in which
they focus on some aspect of the project, highlighting their
individual contributions toward the project's success.  Other students
and faculty will be attending your presentation, so impress us on what
you've done and how great your project is!
<P>The final report is due at the scheduled final exam time for this
class.   The final report is a <EM>technical report</EM>
that includes a self-contained one page summary, suitable for putting
on a web page.  Your technical report should summarize what you've
done in your project, without being redundant with reports written
for the earlier stages.  You should give a final summary of any design
decisions you made during the course of the project, and why you made
the decision you made.
For projects that aim to develop a usable software
system, the technical report must include a "user's manual" that
describes the system to an end-user.  In addition to the team's
project report, each member should individually turn in a short summary
of their own contributions and their own thoughts on
teamwork aspects of the project (specific guidelines will be
provided).
<P>Final reports should be emailed to the instructor in PDF format.  I
will grade these and add comments using the PDF commenting and markup
features, and then will mail this back to you.
