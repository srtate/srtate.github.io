    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Graduate Student Projects</H1>
    
    
    <P><I>This handout provides information for graduate students taking
this class as CSC 693.</I>
<P>As stated on the syllabus, all graduate students are required to
complete an independent project in the class. These projects are
required to be non-trivial applications of Coq to producing certified
software for a useful purpose. There are three ultimate deliverables
for each project: executable code that performs a useful task, Coq
proofs that show that the code does what it is intended to do, and a
project notebook that documents your work on the project.
This last part is similar to an "engineering notebook" that is
common in engineering development, or
a "lab notebook" that is common lab
science work, and serves to document not only successful approaches
but also exploratory ideas that did not work out. Documenting the
things you have tried, and decisions you have made (and why you made
them) is an important part of a mature approach to project development.
The writing in the project notebook isn't expected to be
formal writing, but should clearly describe the work you have done and
decisions you have made.
<P><I>Possible topics and approaches:</I> The only real requirement
here is that your project be centered on useful code (not just 
isolated trivial functions like we've been looking at in the <EM>Software
Foundations</EM> book) that is proved correct in Coq. Below are several
suggestions for approaches, along with one or more project ideas in
each category.
<UL><LI>The "useful code" can be written in Coq itself, properties
  proved about it in Coq, and then the code can be exported to a more
  standard and higher-performance functional language like ML (Coq
  supports this). Some code lends itself to this better than other
  code - in particular, code structured around recursion is going to
  be easier to work with than iterative code. For example, you could
  create a binary search tree data structure, and functions for
  searching, inserting, and deleting data from the binary search
  tree. Or you could implement recursive sorting algorithms such as
  mergesort and quicksort.
<p><LI>The "useful code" could be in the limited imperative
  programming language introduced in the <EM>Software Foundations</EM>
  book. Since we haven't gotten to this part of the book yet, it would
  require reading ahead, but it would allow you to work with code that
  is closer to the style of programming you have seen before. Any
  standard algorithm could be interesting here, although keeping data
  structures simple is important. For example, standard dynamic
  programming algorithms for subsequence problems or for least cost
  edit distance might be feasible in this setting.
<p><LI>Finally, you could include a manual (non-verified) rewriting
  step that takes useful code, converts it into Coq functions that
  capture its functionality, and prove properties that are satisfied
  by the Coq functions. The manual rewriting step clearly leaves a gap
  in the guarantees provided for the code, but this could be seen as
  one step in a larger project that would eventually close that gap
  with Coq-certified translation. For example, a challenging (but
  highly useful and important) project could involve manually
  transforming portions of the OpenSSL "big number" library to Coq
  and proving properties about it. This would involve proofs that relate the
  big number representation in OpenSSL to the Coq integer types, and
  then a proof that the OpenSSL addition function works properly
  (similar to the way the <CODE>binary_commute</CODE> and
  <CODE>binary_inverse</CODE> exercises showed that operations on your
  binary data type "worked correctly"). While the OpenSSL addition
  function is simple, isolated parts of the multiplication function
  could be worked on as well, but the entire multiplication function
  is too complex to tackle for a class project.
</UL>
<P>The project uses the following timeline (all
parts should be turned in through Canvas by midnight on the due
date). Note that the final project due date is December 13, in order
to give you the maximum amount of time possible to work on your
project. However, keep in mind that this is during final exams when
you will have a fairly busy schedule of project and exam dates, so you
need to manage your time sensibly.
<DL><DT><B>Topic/Project Selection - due Tues., Nov. 8 (10 points).</B><DD>
  Within the next week I would like you to decide on a basic project
  idea. I'm happy to discuss any ideas you would like to explore, if
  you are uncertain if or how they could be used as a project. You
  should write a brief, one-paragraph summary that describes: what
  "useful code" will be at the core of your project, and what you
  plan to prove about that code.
<DT><B>Progress Report - due Tues, Nov. 29 (25 points).</B><DD> At this stage
  you should submit your current Coq file and project notebook. I am
  not expecting these to be complete or "polished" at this point, so
  don't worry about submitting a work-in-progress. If you have any
  particular uncertainties in your project that you would like advice
  on, put a note in your project notebook and highlight it. The main
  point is to give me a status report so that I can provide you with
  guidance that will help you complete the project.
<DT><B>Final Submission - due Dec. 13 (65 points).</B><DD> This is the due
  date for all project materials: All code and Coq files, as well as
  your project notebook, with a final entry in the notebook that gives
  a full status report on the project describing what was
  completed/accomplished, and what was not (or what the next steps
  would be if the project were continuing).
