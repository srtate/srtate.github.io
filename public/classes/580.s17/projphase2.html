<center><h1>Project Phase 2 -- Due Tuesday, February 28</h1></center>


<P><P><P>This phase of the project starts with two exercises in which you
explore symmetric cipher availability and performance in the JCA. The
results of the exploration should be put in a simple experiment report with two
sections, as described below. The report should be turned in
(hardcopy) at the beginning of class on the due date.
<P>All Java source code must also be submitted by sharing a
Bitbucket-hosted git repository with me (use my regular UNCG email
address to add me to your repository's access list). You will need to
create a Bitbucket account for this, if you don't already have one --
this can be done at
<A HREF="http://bitbucket.org"><CODE>http://bitbucket.org</CODE></A>. NetBeans
has good support for git version control, and we'll briefly review the basic
operations in class. Code will be graded on code quality and design as
well as whether it functions correctly, so don't write sloppy code!
<OL><LI>Write a Java program named <CODE>ExploreJCA.java</CODE> that discovers what
ciphers (service type "<CODE>Cipher</CODE>") are available on a system
using  the
<CODE>java.security.Security</CODE> and <CODE>java.security.Provider</CODE>
classes. Print out all available ciphers in a readable form,
for each one giving both the provider and the service/algorithm.
<P>The system you explore could be as simple as a regular desktop system
with Java, Standard Edition (JSE), which can be done using NetBeans in
any UNCG lab or on your own system. If you are feeling ambitious, you
can do this for Android and see what algorithms are available there
-- the JCA exploration and enumeration code is the same, but figuring
out how to report the results will take some thought.
<P>The first section of your experiment report should start with
information about the environment you used (both system description
and version numbers) -- the goal is to give enough information so
that someone reading the report could replicate your experiments if
they wanted. After describing the system, give the list of algorithms
that your code reported.
<LI>From the list of supported ciphers, you should benchmark AES and one
other symmetric cipher (these should be two different symmetric
ciphers, not just two different modes for the same cipher). Write two
methods in a file <CODE>JCATime.java</CODE>, one to time single-key
encryption throughput and one to time key testing rate, and use the
NetBeans profiler to time your code as follows:
<UL><LI>Your method to time single-key encryption throughput should
  initialize the Cipher with a key, and then send as much data through
  the cipher as is required for it to run for at last 10 seconds (the data doesn't
  matter, and you can just throw away the ciphertext!). Don't waste
  memory by trying to hold all input data in a single array. Instead,
  allocate a decent-sized array (say, 100,000 bytes) and repeatedly
  encrypt that. You'll
  need to experiment with parameters to determine how much data to
  encrypt, but once you've got that value set you can divide the
  number of bytes encrypted by the number of seconds that your code
  runs to find the encryption throughput.
<LI>Your method to time the key testing rate should loop through
  different keys, and encrypt a single block with each key. The number
  of keys you test should be sufficient for your code to run for at
  least 10 seconds, which will give you a reasonably accurate value
  for the key testing rate measured in keys/second. Each test should
  use a different key, so you'll need a way to step through different
  keys.
</UL>
Remember that you will be graded on good coding practices as well as
your results!  This means that your benchmarking code must be general
purpose -- do <EM>not</EM> write different code to test different
algorithms! You should also use named constants for parameters like the
amount of data to encrypt, etc. Don't hardcode numbers in code
statements!
<P>The second section of your experiment report should start with a
description of the system you used for testing. Since you are
reporting on performance, you should report hardware specifications in
addition to software versions. These specifications should include, at
the very least, the precise processor model and clock speed. The
performance values should then be reported in a table, with rows for
algorithms and columns for the two tests. Remember to specify units
for any measurement!
<LI>At the heart of the secure chat application is a class (named
<CODE>Conversation</CODE>, for example) that 
sends and receives encrypted messages -- that is what you are to
write for this part of the assignment. The precise definition of how
this should work depends on the outcome of our phase 1 design
discussion (planned for Thursday, February 9). Regardless of the exact
requirements, make sure you give careful thought to
good, modular design using multiple classes. For example, there should
be a class that is responsible for managing keys for a
conversation that is initialized when the conversation is
established. We won't cover how to establish these keys until later in
the course, so for now this class should associate a key of all zeros
with every conversation. This class can be updated in a later phase,
and if you're careful then the <CODE>Conversation</CODE> class will be usable
with little or no changes.
