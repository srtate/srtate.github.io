<center><h1>Homework 1 &ndash; Due Tuesday, January 24</h1></center>

<P><P><P><I>Reminder:</I>
Homework problems are for you to develop skills and to practice. Once
you get a handle on solving these problems, think of generalizations
and practice those as well. Clear communication is as important as the
right technical idea, and you should write up your solutions clearly
so that they can be understood by a non-specialist (and non-mindreader!).
<P>Next Tuesday (Jan 24) students will
exchange papers and we will discuss solutions. There will be a quiz on
Thursday (Jan 26) consisting of a single problem similar to one of
these.
<OL><LI>Consider a dishonest owner of a coffee shop that provides free WiFi
  service to its customers. Briefly describe one passive attack and one active
  attack that the owner could perform on its customers who use WiFi.
<p><LI>Draw a system model, identifying data at various parts in the system,
for processing a credit card purchase in a store. I'm not expecting
you to know or report on how this <EM>actually</EM> works in stores
today, but I want you to think, from your own personal experience,
about the "pieces" in such a system and how they could work
together.
g<p><LI>Draw an attack tree for stealing a car. Your attack tree should show
various attacks, but you do not have to estimate the cost of attacks.
</OL>
