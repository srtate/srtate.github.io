<center><h1>Project Phase 1 -- Due Tuesday, February 7</h1></center>

<P><P><P>Review the system requirements from the project's "Basic
Information" handout, and consider a situation in which a user Alice wishes
to start a secure chat session with Bob. During the chat session, she
will send at least one secure message to Bob, and will receive one
secure reply from him. As you work on the following
problems, think in particular about the second through fourth security
requirements from that handout (the first requirement deals
with efficiency rather than security, and we will deal with that later).
<P>At this point in the class you are not expected to know much
about how cryptographic protections work or what the requirements
are for applying various security techniques. This does create a
challenge in thinking through the design, but do the best you can --
we will discuss design ideas and adjust as you learn more.
<OL><LI>Draw a basic system model for the secure chat system that shows the
different parties (Alice, Bob, and the chat hub). Label parts of the
diagram where data might be stored or transmitted, and outline three
basic operational steps:
<UL><LI>Alice establishes a session with Bob.
  <LI>Alice sends a message to Bob.
  <LI>Bob sends a message to Alice.
</UL>
For each step, describe what information/data each participant must
start the step with, and what confidentiality and integrity
requirements exist for that data. Note that "data" means more than
just a message that needs to be sent, and should include secrets or
public information that is used to
protect other data and to identify users. Also do your
best to describe how much trust is placed in the chat hub (for
example, is the hub trusted with secret information? is it trusted to
identify chat participants?).
<p><LI>Consider security requirements two through four from the original
handout, and for each one draw an attack tree for attacks against that
security goal. Types of attacks to consider include compromising an
end-user's system, compromising the chat hub, and intercepting or
tampering with communication anywhere in the system.
