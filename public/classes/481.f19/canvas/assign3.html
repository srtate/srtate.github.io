<p>Complete the “<a href="http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/Software/Buffer_Overflow/">Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab</a>” from the Syracuse SEED Labs. As in the last assignment, you can either use a virtual machine on your own computer, or the one that is set up for you on the class server.</p>
<p><em>Note/Warning: “Task 2 (Exploiting the Vulnerability)” in this lab does not require a lot of code/work, but it must be <strong>very precise</strong> and requires a good understanding of assembly language and low-level CPU operations (as covered in our CSC 261 class). Students often struggle with this task, and since all of the following tasks depend on getting this right, you should try to get Task 2 done as soon as possible. We will discuss the concepts in class, and the videos linked from the SEED Lab are also helpful if you get stuck.</em></p>
