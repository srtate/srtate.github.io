      <h3 class="mt-4">Overview</h3>

      
<p class="ml-4">Catalog description: System programming with emphasis
on processes, memory management, multithreaded programming,
synchronization and deadlocks, interprocess communication, parallel
and distributed computing, networking, files systems, security,
signals, and virtualization containers.</p>
<p class="ml-4">
Longer Description: This class is a programming-focused class,
exploring how programs interact with the operating system and use
system and related services. As far as programming level, you can
consider it as sitting between CSC 261 (hardware and assembly
language) and CSC 130/230 (higher-level programming without hard
connection to the underlying system). The class will use C for
programming in a Linux environment, interacting with the system
through Linux system calls, the standard C library, and support
libraries such as pthreads. The class is heavy on specifics and
concrete details, and light on theory/generality which will be covered
in a later class (CSC 462 -- Principles of Operating Systems).</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Spring 2021 Note</h3>

<p class="ml-4">For the safety of everyone, this class will be offered
as a remote/online class in Spring 2021 due to the ongoing COVID
pandemic. All class and individual meetings will use <a
href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a> for videoconferencing &ndash; links
and more information are available in Canvas. Classes are at the
scheduled time, and students are expected to attend at that
time. There will be real-time group exercises, using Zoom breakout
rooms, which students are required to participate in. A Linux virtual
machine image (configured for use with <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a>) will be provided to
students so that there is a uniform system environment for all
students to use.  Students must have a computer that is capable of
hosting this virtual environment -- any modern system with at least
8GB of RAM should be fine.  In addition, class activities will include
group work (through Zoom breakout rooms) so students must have
camera/audio capabilities for collaboration during class and be able
to share their virtual machine screen for group programming
exercises. During in-class activities, students will be
expected to share their screen with the entire class and explain their
solution to an in-class programming activity.</p>
