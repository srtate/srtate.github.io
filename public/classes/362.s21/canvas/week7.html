<p>Review Chapter 12 (Filesystems)</p>
<h4 id="tuesday-material">Tuesday Material</h4>
<p>Structured organization for data - hierarchical, named, … Backed by HDD or SSD. (defined “backed”) - get current speeds! - mention network filesystems? - directory info vs contents - [ various levels at which RAID can exist ] Storage sizes - KiB, MiB, GiB for powers of two (note historical confusion) - “kibibyte” etc. - RAM vs HDD for sizes - “ISO compliant” “Everything is a file” - remember /proc API: open, read, write, close. - behind the scenes - handle reliability, manage space, encryption, etc. - “mount point” - common linux filesystems: ext4, procfs, sysfs, tmpfs, sshfs. - [also mention zfs, btrfs, …] - most advanced API: chmod, ioctl, link, … - seekable vs not. Mentions FUSE. Storing data on disk: blocks, inodes, superblock [analogy for inode vs name?] - book mentions “name” after talking about inodes - misleading - metadata: size, times, permissions, checksum, … - [ file vs directory - but inodes for both - can’t read dir directly ] - inode limits - limiting number of files - note name isn’t really significant - just how you find the inode. [ various kinds of links and what mv really does ] - unused block ptrs in inode, and slack space [define!] in partial block [also mention sparse files] indirect blocks - [ draw tree - find pictures? ] - limits on file sizes due to structure - note issue for FAT and our VM! - “ls -i” to show inode - Dir convenstions - . and .., shell features like ~ - hidden, … Directory API - opendir, closedir, readdir - use open or mkdir to change - remember to close - book entry of leaving dir open - resource leak Links: hard (show w/ls -i), soft/symbolic [ extra layer of redirection ] paths and “realpath” to get canonical path Metadata - stat, fstat, and lstat - look at stat struct - mode interp macros Permission and bits - we did this already - basically just tell students to read/review - umask - we didn’t talk about this… - setuid bit (and syscalls getuid, geteuid, … diff types of uid) - sticky bit and meaning for dirs [ also setgid bit on dirs? ] Virtual filesystems - /dev, /proc, /sys - special files inlcude /dev/zero and /dev/null - /dev/random and /dev/urandom (“allows for repetition” is not correct) - talks about dd and use for copying random data from /dev/urandom - “touch” to update mod time (fake out make) [and create file] - mount and loopback mounting of an iso [mention full disk encryption?] Memory mapped IO - mmap Reliability, etc. - caching, write-back vs write-through, and sync (at filesystem and file level) - MTTF - RAID</p>

<p>Show man page for readdir 2 and 3 Code - read dir Code - mode bit tests - various combinations (read or execute/ read and ex) Shell commands: mount and df Special files: /dev/zero, /dev/null, /dev/random, … - Show them, and then show use for /dev/null (redir stderr to /dev/null) - xxd others and pipe through more or head - dd to copy out 512 bytes of random data</p>
