<h4 id="for-students-to-do-before-tuesday">For students to do before Tuesday</h4>
<p>Reading…</p>
<h4 id="tuesday-material">Tuesday Material</h4>
<p>In class:</p>
<p>Slide and status update first, but then straight to demos to do ones missed last time.</p>
<p>First talk briefly about testing and incremental development. Show input loop and all that has to work correctly is the input and the push (which was done in class). - you’ve got to have a plan for testing and debugging. should never contact me with just an “it doesn’t work” statement - tell me what you tried, what you expected to see, and what you saw. - sense of accomplishment if nothing else! - and remember - only output what is asked for! It’s a specification, not a suggestion!</p>
<p>Didn’t do later demos on Thursday: I/O * example3a vs example3b with “time” (use an 8MB file) * example3c for line buffering of printf Example 4: Error handling * Add errno (remember to include errno.h) - good for compare, not understandable * Then print using strerror(errno) (include string.h) * Finally print with perror(“Opening my file”);</p>
<p>Didn’t cover from last week’s list: - keywords: const, enum, extern, goto, static - void * and auto-casting - preprocessor for define (const and macro) and ifdef - header files and multi-file programs - fn prototypes - role of makefiles</p>
<p>Common bugs - copying ptrs instead of pted to; quitting before NUL copied. - double frees [ first is actually use-after-free ] - returning ptr to local var - insufficient memory allocation - esp using size of ptr insted of ptd-to - buffer overflow/underflow - not allocating NUL char space (need strlen(s)+1 bytes) - uninitialized variables (or assuming will be zeroed Logic and program flow mistakes - equal vs equality (tip: constants first) [note how not a prob in Java] - undeclared or incorrectly protyped functions - extra semicolons (kills body of loop)</p>
<p>** Check questions/exercises at end</p>
<p>[gdb and compiler flags - next week]</p>
<p>[Text vs binary data and Base64; xxd and strings] [bit manipulation - masks, etc.] [gcc vs clang vs …; Talk a little about Rust]</p>
<p>Section 14.2: “Security in C Programs”</p>

<p>Stuff</p>
<h4 id="for-students-to-do-before-thursday">For students to do before Thursday</h4>
<p>???</p>
<h4 id="thursday-material">Thursday Material</h4>
<p>Reminders: Accept the class invitation! If not, you can’t see example code repos (or shouldn’t be able to…)</p>
<p>Tuesday: Covered multi-file and preprocessor. Did not go through application. Also skipped the “Common C Errors” slide. Need to cover those on Thurs.</p>
<p>Topics for Thurs:</p>
<p>Security in C programs:</p>
<p>Stack smashing - buffer overflow ex using strcpy - dangers - strncpy tries to fix, but does a bad job (discuss) - strlcpy is better, but only in bsd-compat libraries - stack smashing can wait until later - prob security class A bogus explanation of spectre OS security - permissions (we talked about) - ASLR and stack protectors - DEP (write xor execute) Valgrind - example detecting memory leak (stack) ** Need to install! use “sudo apt install valgrind” - Basic run, but book suggests “–leak-check=full –show-leak-kinds=all” - Note checks heap accesses by hooking malloc/free - no stack errs - Heap out of bounds and stack out of bounds - ASAN? GDB - Use of -g flag - breakpoints - note starting gdb and “start” - avoid programatic breakpoints + and conditional “break .. if …” - examining variables - mention getting down to the register/assembly level but don’t dwell</p>
