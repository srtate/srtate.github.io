<p>Read Chapter 6 (or part?)</p>
<p>Thread - sequence of instructions executed - multiple threads share same addr space - diff stack locations (like fork, but no COW/copying of mem space) - clone() is syscall that does this, but we’ll not use that - also called “lightweight processes” or LWP When to use processes - when you want separation (security), stand-alone program exec, as a way of clustering threads, when you need truly independent scheduling (blocking I/O in a thread blocks all threads??) When to use threads - leverage multicore for unified task, want less overhead, want simpler communication between threads [role of pthread library - and underlying linux syscalls] Thread internals - same addr space, separate stacks - created by pthread lib (same heap, data) [gives pic, but can do better…] - pthread_create for a new thread * ptr to function - new C construct! (note used by qsort) [more on types and casting] [“threadsafe libraries” or functions, and "_r" versions] [note issue with testing in VM - how many virtual cores?] Examples showing pthread_create - lib and header requirements [on examples - use book? - note similarity to queue_t use] - walk through pointer-to-fn type form [find old C type forms info?] - result returned via pthread_join Functions: pthread_create, pthread_cancel, pthread_exit, pthread_join Race conditions - outcome determined by how threads are scheduled (non-deterministic) [slightly more specific meaning in security - toctou] - example with variable getting updated - interleaved rwrw or rrww? [atomic operations, assembly code, etc.] - example with conflicting use of a static local</p>
