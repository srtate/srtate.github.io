<p>So first understand how process isolation works, and opportunities for sharing Virtual memory - basic idea - 4 step process in book: request, check TLB, MMU translation, actual access - basic idea and need for pages (could also mention segments) - memory sizes/page sizes/number pages for 32 and 64 bit machines - “page” (4kb in book) [show “getconf -a” in VM - search for “PAGE” - can also show things like PATH_MAX - configurable on some archs, incl ia64] + will see how to do this programmatically with “sysconf” later + also look in smaps for a process and show in top + use /proc/<br /><span class="math display">/<em>s</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>s</em> − −</span><br /> is current PID - “page table” maps from page offset to frame number (vm to phys) + “frame” typically means phys, “page” virtual, although not a real def - address bits - page and offset parts + pic in book for single page table + calc size of single page table for 32-bit and 64-bit archs + note about sparse page tables - esp a little at bottom and a little at top - maybe work through this with a specific example? - multi-level page tables + pic.. - 10 bits for each level + find picture of actual PT entry from intel docs? + prob: now 3 accesses per mem read! - role of TLB + [note effect on efficiency and ineff in context switching] - note how <em>virtual</em> memory and paging can be supported - sharing pages between processes - protections/segfault<br />
+ ro pages, esp for shared libs + mmap + other page bits: dirty bit, + [ get back to COW idea with fork? ] + page faults - minor (just not mapped yet), major (swap in), invalid mmap - note that IPC <em>could</em> be done by writing to a file that others read, but… - note POSIX again, so portable… - idea map vm page to file block - same file = sharing (“sync” to file) + lazy allocation/loading - don’t read the whole file! + reserves address space, but that’s it up-front - flags: protections, sharing/private - private for I/O ops, not sharing? - example - opens file, gets size (fstat - rel to stat), + note that offset must be a multiple of page size - explain bit manip! - overall security benefit comment: share some carefully-chosen mem, but not all! pipes - POSIX again - saw from a command-line standpoint - pipe system call (ex is use right before fork) + both ends always created in one process, so only useful before a fork - note common gotcha with reading until EOF - EOF In a pipe requires close + close by all writers - incl the reader process that inherits? - example with SIGPIPE, but haven’t talked about signal handlers yet! - buffering and “filling up” a pipe + writes to a pipe are atomic (up to size of pipe) + note pipe size traditionally very limited (page size) + [way to change pipe buffer size - use fcntl] - example with pipe2 (pipe with flags) and dup2 to attach to stdin/stdout - using fdopen to wrap for buffered I/O</p>
<p>[??: can put mutex’s or cond vars in mmap shared space? prob not….]</p>
<p>[??: anonymous shared space w/o munmap? sticks around?]</p>
<p>POSIX page: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/mmap.html Linux page: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html</p>
<p>For demos: - “getconf -a” (then pipe to “grep PAGE”) and “getconf PAGE_SIZE” (also look at PATH_MAX, for example) + do “man sysconf” to show how a program can get this info - Do more /proc/<br /><span class="math display">/<em>s</em><em>m</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>s</em>(<em>m</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em></span><br /> is PID Of shell, smaps is detailed) - strace with hello world and show uses of mmap - Example code to open, gets file size (fstat!), and mmap + Example 2: open new file - maybe even in /tmp? - Example: two shell windows, one will read a string from user and put in mmap, other will read that, then look at backing file after exit.</p>

<p>TS data structures notes:</p>
<p>Examples: * Get a big data file to process using combinations of cut, sort, uniq, etc. * strings with grep and wc (or nm with grep and wc) * Two windows: mkfifo, then ls -l to show, then cat fifo in one and echo to in other window * Code to fork/exec with a pipe (using dup2)</p>
