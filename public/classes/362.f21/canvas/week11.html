<h3 id="spring-2021-timing">Spring 2021 Timing</h3>
<p>Tuesday (3/30)</p>
<ul>
<li>[5 min] Intro</li>
<li>[20 min] Slides through “switchboard slide”</li>
<li>[15 min] Demo with two windows, two machines (VM and ritchie)
<ul>
<li>Netcat from VM to ritchie (can ask others to connect)</li>
<li>ifconfig to see IP addresses/interfaces</li>
<li>new window, netstat showing connection</li>
</ul></li>
<li>[15.5 min] Rest of slides<br />
</li>
<li>[14 min]
<ul>
<li>[3 min] man socket and man 7 socket - all the protocols, then man 7 ip</li>
<li>[5 min] bring up tcpclient.c - see .h for config settings - run</li>
<li>[6 min] look at tcpserver.c and go through</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Total slides+examples: 65 min - prob can’t do much faster….</p>
<ul>
<li>Could try to move wireshark example here (saves 5 min from Thurs)</li>
<li>Or maybe move app-layer here and can show http in netcat?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update server example to use threads?</strong></p>
<p>Proj reminder: use valgrind!</p>
<p>Thursday (4/1)</p>
<ul>
<li>[3 min] Intro</li>
<li>[44 min] Slides</li>
<li>[16 min]
<ul>
<li>[6.5 min] “man -k ntoh” then wireshark w/nc between windows</li>
<li>[9.5 min] Look at udpclient, udpserver, run</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Total slides+examples: 60 min</p>

<p>Networking is now as fundamental as computing (or more so) [Socket history refresher - BSD] OSI model - all 7 layers described. Layer 3: The Internet Protocol - [“domain” or “address family” (see socket man page)] - “IPv4” - packets from one machine to another - 32 bit addresses - form (dotted addresses - four octets) + can think of as a network address and host address - IPv4 header - 20 octets - Special IPv4 addresses: 127.0.0.1 [mention private subnets] - IPv6 bigger address range and security - What’s my address? + command line + Programmatically: getifaddrs and getnameinfo + Example code going through list … - Getting address of another system: getaddrinfo [talk about DNS?] Layer 4: TCP and Client - [ see socket type in “man socket” - include some in slides ] - [ SOCK_STREAM is “full-duplex byte stream” ] - Transport layer - gives illusion of a pipe between processes anywhere + [one diff with pipe - full-duplex - each end has diff write/read handles] + ordered, error checked, etc. point out why important - IP best effort + multiple connections - id’ed by src/dest ip/port + privileged ports [don’t rely on for security!] + give some common ports (80, 22, etc.) /etc/services - Things TCP doesn’t provide: security/encryption, reconn, data packets - Network order, and htons/ntohs/etc. + s:short is 16 bits; l:long is 32 bits. + note that network is big endian, x86 is little endian - TCP client + about sockets + socket, getaddrinfo, and connect [more complex than it needs to be…] + gethostbyname is deprecated…. + setcockopt for more advanced options - read/write works like a file (really more like a pipe) + less immediate though, so blocking/non-blocking is important + [example in book use http - need something simpler to start] Layer 4: TCP Server - socket as before, but then bind, listen, and accept - close or shutdown when done - gives example server - notes about interrupted read calls (EINTR return)</p>
<p>Presentation - start with the end goal - TCP connection on a port - maybe even start with the netcat demo then back to slides? - find old switchboard operator picture….</p>
<p>Demos: Earlier “breakout demo” - use nc between diff machines - talk about firewalls… use port 8080 Man pages Use ifconfig to show address (and “ip addr show”) Use netcat - talk about ports, etc. Show connection status in netstat TCP client code - look at code and then run (connect to nc) TCP server code - look at code and run (connect to with nc)</p>

<p>OSI model - all 7 layers described. Layer 3: The Internet Protocol - IPv4 header - 20 octets</p>
<p>[Note prioritization issues, congestion control, and net neutrality]</p>
<p>[send and recv syscalls?]</p>
<p>Book, from section 5:</p>
<p>Layer 4: UDP - [Note UDP is <em>user</em> datagram protocol - not unreliable as book says] - [discrete units - packets - sent - not a stream] - connectionless protocol - send a packet, get a packet…. + may be dropped, duplicated, or arrive out of order + warning - testing often doesn’t account for this (test on loopback) - when speed/updates more important than reliability + also mention streaming media - can’t “fall behind” because of corrections + and multicast - UDP client + Book’s example uses gethostbyname - why?!? + Add a timeout using SO_RCVTIMEO in setsockopt (otherwise what if lost?) - UDP Server + socket and bind like before - ex uses priv port - why??? + but then no conn to establish, so just call “recvfrom” + note recvfrom is a one shot deal - make sure buffer is big enough or lose data Layer 7: HTTP - application-level interfaces - book muddles the http/https and TLS discussion a bit - other app-level protocols - ftp, tftp, dns, smtp, ssh, ntp, … + [show some of these in wireshark] - about DNS - fast but insecure - https adds assurance via certs + understand security issues through insecurity of UDP + talks about DNSSEC a little - [refer to security class] + for this class, mention DNS over HTTPS Non-Blocking IO - Set flag so read doesn’t wait. + use fcntl to set the O_NONBLOCK flag, or use SOCK_NONBLOCK for socket - use select to wait on multiple file descriptors + Uses fd_set/FD_ZERO/FD_SET to create vector of descriptors -epoll - not POSIX, but supported by Linux as more efficient than select + Basically kernel-managed select…. + level triggered vs edge triggered; epoll of epolls?; one-shot; … Remote procedure calls - idea call a function in a diff process (poss on diff machine) + [use file locking in NFS as an example?] - privileges of called function, and notion of privilege separation - idea of a “stub function” + marshalling/unmarshalling data - [no diff from file format issues] - interface description language + Ex: Google’s Protocol Buffer (.proto) files - complexities: slow (both comm and local processing), versioning, security - transferring structured data - JSON, XML, or Protocol Buffers (or YAML)</p>
<p>Other notes: - send vs write - only diff is flags</p>
<p>Demo: - wireshark - talk about - monitor an “nc” connection tcp - then monitor “nc” connection udp - then look at code - point out binary packets, specific sizes, and ntohl - discuss activity</p>
