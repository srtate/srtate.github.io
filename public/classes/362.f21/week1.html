        <h2 id="csc-362-spring-2021-week-1-activities">CSC 362 – Spring 2021 – Week 1 Activities</h2>
<h4 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h4>
<p>In class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record - and ask for reminders!</li>
<li>Slides with brief course info/introduction</li>
<li>Syllabus review - bring up syllabus and share
<ul>
<li>Initial items: Info on meetings (required/synchronous) and office hours (other times possible, but will need to email to set up a time - I don’t keep Zoom running….)</li>
<li>New course (2nd time); always open to constructive criticism</li>
<li>Class description and position between 261 and 462 - heavy programming</li>
<li>MUST be competent at programming coming in to this class. -&gt; Last time: people blaming C when it was really basic programming 300-level is beyond “programming instruction” -&gt; Deliberate practice! Can you imagine a musician or BB player not praciticing? If you only write the programs you’re told to write, you’ll have problems.</li>
<li>Linux focused, which is important skill to have - but portable</li>
<li>Web page vs Canvas - show web page and explain separation - still mostly in Canvas and GitHub, but keeping public page for external info - click on a few - syllabus and schedule - then bring up Canvas and show important nav links - class, office hours, Panopto; then modules, assignments, and discussions.</li>
<li>Book/references: Click on link and show - Book comes from a student-written Wiki, and quality and comprehensiveness varies by topic. Will try to give pointers to other references when available. Read and get familiar with topic before class. Learning works best by getting a good basic understanding, then reinforced by discussion and questions, then practice.</li>
<li>Teaching methods: General structure of a class, then general structure of a week. In-class activities released during beginning of class - want you working on them together, not doing them before class. Weekly assignment due each week – individual solutions, but can work with each other for help. Major assignments are individual work. Exams will be at a fixed, given time. More on that later.</li>
<li>Grade percentages - keep an eye on this in Canvas. Will drop 1 or 2 weekly assignments, depending on demands of the semester.</li>
<li>Late policy: Up to a week late, but one fixed late penalty. GitHub submissions – commit messages mark the version to grade. If you forget, won’t be graded until the late assignment deadline, and some points will be taken off.</li>
<li>In-class behavior: Professionalism in Zoom. Camera view, screen contents, etc.</li>
<li>[Goal for time to here: 35 min]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Role of operating system and use of virtual machines
<ul>
<li>General concepts - picture of HW/OS/Applications - then VM</li>
<li>Importance of VM for consistency between students, even if other approaches work. Use the VM unless there is some reason you just can’t.</li>
<li>What can you do in VM? Some basic commands for interaction (will show)</li>
<li>Need to work with files - editor is primary tool - options…</li>
<li>[Goal for time to here: 55 min]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Demos
<ul>
<li>Show “Set-up Information” module - talk abt GitHub acct and VM</li>
<li>Show VirtualBox - provided file creates a VM, talk about download (size/time) and show where “Import” is. Need to do this before Thursday!</li>
<li>Show loaded VM and go through some virtual hardware settings.
<ul>
<li>“General/Advanced/Shared Clipboard”: Talk about isolation and value of that, but also difficult of working with. Jump down to “Shared Folders” and talk about similar things there. While not required, I encourage you to keep both of these sharing options disabled and keep the VM as an isolated environment. All classwork will be transfers in and out of VM via GitHub.</li>
<li>System/RAM: 1GB is probably OK, but more gives better in-VM caching, esp important when running a web browser in VM; mentally subtract RAM amount from host, and think that is what your host is working with, so on a 4GB system, a 2GB VM is a big hit</li>
<li>System/CPUs: Set for 2 – needed for some multithreading, but can dial back or up; unlike mem, CPUs are shared so not “taken away” from host</li>
<li>Storage: Virtual disks - entire disk (vdi) in one or more files; can insert and remove disks (show on optical drive)</li>
<li>Network: This is complicated, because it controls how the VM communicates with the outside world - is it part of your local network? Is it isolated? Is there a virtual network of multiple VMs? Default setting - NAT - acts roughly the same way a computer/device on a home network would act, behind your WiFi/router where in this case the router is in the host&lt;-&gt;VM interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show snapshots and talk about value…</li>
<li>Boot VM. Talk about using Lubuntu. Desktop; quick launch links at bottom for web browser and shell. Note that much in this class will be done from the shell. Open “Visual Studio Code” from “Programming” and talk about it.</li>
<li>Show basic ls, ls -l, cd, and cat commands</li>
<li>Open a file in editors - vi and VS Code and try to convey GUI vs text</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Student reminders – For Thursday: Boot it up, can bring up applications/shell and experiment, but don’t change any settings yet. We’ll set some initial things up in class on Thursday.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="for-students-to-do-before-thursday">For students to do before Thursday</h4>
<ul>
<li>Register for GitHub acct if you don’t have one (use .edu for edu benefits)</li>
<li>Install VirtualBox if they don’t already have it</li>
<li>Download and import VM image</li>
<li>Set up ssh authentication if possible</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="thursday-material">Thursday Material</h4>
<p><strong>Talk about M1-based macs and the VM.</strong></p>
<p><em>Ack did miss the “editors” slide last time, will talk about this today.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Linux and history of Unix/Linux/POSIX - incl android
<ul>
<li>Linux vs GNU/Linux vs distribution [Time for this was 40 min in Spring 2021 - should be MUCH shorter (15?)] [ Prob need to simplify slides for this… ]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Git and GitHub (and the differences)</li>
<li>GitHub classroom - workflow (<em>very</em> brief)</li>
<li>[Goal for time to here: 25 min]</li>
</ul>
<p>Demos - Bring up VM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Should have set everything up and accepted inclass invitation
<ul>
<li>Basic desktop components - start menu, launch buttons, open windows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GitHub: Show inclass-srtate2 in web - note Week01 dir
<ul>
<li>Local copy vs copy in github - first time “clone” after that “pull”</li>
<li>Note message in terminal with failed clone - must use ssh (or token)</li>
<li>Do quick ssh setup</li>
<li>Then pull both inclass and examples</li>
<li>Note “Contributors” and Issues - good track work and way to ask questions!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Talk about terminal window and command line - bash (mention Putty)
<ul>
<li>git basics, and set git var values - use “Steve Demo” for name..</li>
<li>talk about cut/copy/paste in terminal then cut/paste commands</li>
<li>will dig into shell (bash) deeply next week</li>
<li>git basics - edits tagged by who is responsible, so set that up!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Show VS Code and talk about what it is - alternative editors
<ul>
<li>Bring up README - edit and show preview - multiple ways to start</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Edit README
<ul>
<li>Talk about what Markdown is</li>
<li>Look at saved/unsaved icon - save, go back to shell and do “git status”</li>
<li>Then “git add”, “git commit”, and “git push” - show result in github</li>
<li>Add new file and re-do<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>[Goal for time to here: 40 min - 25 slides, 15 demo]</p></li>
<li>If there is additional time in demos:
<ul>
<li>use ssh to log in to ritchie.uncg.edu</li>
<li>Ways to get help: git –help, man, man -k, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Note: only need to save 10 min for wrap-up this time.
<ul>
<li>I could show what someone’s repo looks like to me - show access</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="thursday-in-class-activities">Thursday In-Class Activities</h4>
<ul>
<li>For in-class activity - random breakout rooms - “Ask for Help” to call me</li>
<li>Pick a team lead in each room - hopefully one of you is ready to go!</li>
<li>Emphasize one commit per team - from team lead</li>
<li>Remember: ALL cameras on!</li>
<li>You will: Set <code>git</code> variables for identification, update repo and commit/push
<ul>
<li>Encourage to always do git status when you think things are in a certain state (like submitted), so you can see if things are as you believe!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ALWAYS check github web site to see results</li>

<li>Accept github classroom assignment and clone repo</li>
<li>Read basic markdown tutorial</li>
