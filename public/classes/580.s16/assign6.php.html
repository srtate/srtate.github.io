    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 6 - Due Thursday, April 21</H1>

<OL><LI>For this problem you will need to compute some SHA-256 hash values, so
you will need software to do that. You can either locate and install
free software on your own computer, or you can log in to the UNCG
Linux host <TT>prdile.uncg.edu</TT> and use the <TT>sha256sum</TT>
program.
<OL><LI>Create a text file that contains only your name, and compute the
  SHA-256 digest of that file. Give the first 10 hexadecimal digits of
  the digest as the answer to this problem.
<LI>Change the text file by changing a single letter in your name
  (creating a "typo"). Compute the SHA-256 digest of this modified
  file, and give the first 10 hexadecimal digits of
  the digest as the answer to this problem. <I>Also give the
    input so that I know what "typo" you created.</I>
<LI>How similar are these digests? Are any of the hexadecimal digits
  the same?
</OL>
<p><LI>Hash values are very useful for identifying files and programs,
  since they give a short identifier for the file contents (regardless
  of the name used). For example, if some malware left a program named
  "WORD.EXE" on your computer and you saw the file, how could you
  tell if that file is a genuine
  copy of MS Word, or not? For this problem, explore on the Internet
  for malware hash databases. Once you find one and learn a little
  about how it works, look up the following SHA-1 hash (you may want to cut
  and paste this from the electronic copy on the class web page):

</PRE>
  If you found something with this hash value on your computer, what
  is it? Report what you find as your answer to this question (you
  don't need to go into great depth, but at least give its name and
  explain what it is).    
<p><LI>Clearly a hash function that has the strong collision resistance
  property also has weak collision resistance. What about the next
  step down? Does a hash function that has weak collision resistance
  also satisfy the one-way property (see Table 11.1 on page 323 for
  these terms)? To answer this question, consider a hash function <I>H(x)</I>
  that produces <I>k</I>-bit hash codes, and satisfies all three of these
  security properties. Now construct a hash function <I>H'(x)</I> that
  produces <I>(k+1)</I>-bit hash codes as follows: If <I>x</I> is exactly <I>k</I> bits
  long, then output <I>0|x</I> (a single 0 bit followed by <I>x</I>); otherwise
  output <I>1|H(x)</I> (a single 1 bit followed by the <I>H</I>-hash code of <I>x</I>). Is
  <I>H'(x)</I> weakly collision resistant? Is it one-way? Justify your
  answers!
<p><LI>Consider a function <I>f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup> -&gt; {0,1}<sup>h</sup></I> that satisfies
the one-way and collision-resistance (both weak and strong) properties
of a cryptographic hash function, even though it only works on
fixed-size input blocks.  Joe needs a function like this, but it has
to work on <EM>pairs</EM> of <I>n</I>-bit inputs, so he defines
<I>g:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>&#215;{0,1}<sup>n</sup> -&gt; {0,1}<sup>h</sup></I> as
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>  g(x,y) = f(x(XOR)y) . </I></BLOCKQUOTE>
Is this function one-way?  Does it satisfy the weak collision
resistance property?  Justify both answers!
<p><LI>Consider a hardware device that has a random 256-bit secret <I>k</I> built
into the hardware, where a user can supply a bitstring <I>x</I> to the
hardware and it will compute HMAC<I>(k,x)</I> (the HMAC is computed using
hash function SHA-256). Consider a system that uses this hardware to
create a 256-bit key for AES: The user supplies a 4-digit PIN for <I>x</I>,
and then the output of the hardware HMAC is an AES key that is used to
encrypt some sensitive data. Given a potential key, we can quickly tell
whether it is the correct key by attempting a decryption using it. For
this problem, assume that HMAC with SHA-256 satisfies the desired MAC
security properties from Section 12.4 of the textbook.
<OL><LI>Consider a case where the data encrypted in this manner is
  captured, but the device itself is not available to the attacker. In addition to
  having the data, the attacker knows the algorithm that is used and
  knows that <I>x</I> is a 4-digit PIN (but doesn't know <I>x</I>). How secure is this? Reason about
  the "best possible attack" given the security of HMAC, and give
  some indication of how much time this would take. I'm not looking
  for a mathematical proof -- informal reasoning is
 OK, but make sure the logic of your reasoning is clear!
<LI>If the device is captured as well, so that the attacker can
  access the HMAC-computing hardware device, what is the best attack
  in this case? How much time would this take (state any assumptions
  you need to make about the speed of the hardware device, etc.).
<LI>What if the hardware keeps track of the number of failed
  attempts, and wipes out the embedded secret after 10 incorrect
  entries to the device? How does this affect what the attacker can do?
</OL>
<I>This is basically the scenario presented with newer iPhone
  hardware, although Apple apparently provides a way 
  to update the firmware of the security hardware which leaves a
  security hole.</I>
<p><LI>Textbook page 230, Problem 7.6.
<p><LI>Alice uses a stream cipher that generates a "key stream" of
bytes <I>k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, ..., k<sub>n</sub></I> that is exclusive-ORed with the
plaintext <I>p<sub>1</sub>, p<sub>2</sub>, ..., p<sub>n</sub></I> to produce ciphertext bytes <I>c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>,
..., c<sub>n</sub></I>.  Imagine that Alice shows you the first part of
the plaintext (say it's a header), and you also have access to the ciphertext.
You make a suggestion regarding the header that will be followed by
the unsuspecting Alice and will allow you to decode the entire message
<EM>regardless</EM> of how secure the key stream is!  Here's how: you
tell Alice to delete the first character <CODE>&amp;</CODE> (or something else
in the header) because it's not needed, and then re-encrypt the text.
Alice obliges by decrypting her file, deleting the <CODE>&amp;</CODE> from
the header, and then re-encrypts with the same key stream.  If the
deleted character is originally in position <I>m</I> (which you know, since you've
seen the header), then she is encrypting the plaintext 
<I>p<sub>1</sub>,p<sub>2</sub>,...,p<sub>m-1</sub>,p<sub>m+1</sub>,...,p<sub>n</sub></I>.
Show how you can use the two ciphertexts, along with knowledge of
the position <I>m</I> and character <CODE>&amp;</CODE>, in order to decode the entire
message!
