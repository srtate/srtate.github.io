    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 2 - Due Tuesday, February 16</H1>


<OL><LI>Compute the following GCD's using the Euclidean algorithm
  presented in Section 4.2. Show each step and intermediate result.
<UL><LI>(a) gcd(20259, 41962)
<LI>(b) gcd(750588,374851)
</UL>
<p><LI>Compute gcd(472,7107) using the <EM>Extended</EM> Euclidean
  algorithm given in Section 4.3. Show each step and intermediate
  result. Note that for inputs <I>a</I> and <I>b</I>, the Extended Euclidean
  algorithm finds not only gcd<I>(a,b)</I> but also values <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> so
  that <I>ax+by=gcd(a,b)</I> -- make sure you clearly mark <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> in
  your final answer.
<p><LI>Textbook page 125, Problem 4.2
<p><LI>Textbook page 125, Problem 4.3
<p><LI>Textbook page 126, Problem 4.12, adding the additional requirement that <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are natural numbers, and for part (a) further assume
  that <I>a &gt;= b</I> -- this way no values will be negative.
<p><LI>For the following questions, use polynomial arithmetic over GF(2):
<UL><LI>(a) What is the product of <I>x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+1</I> and <I>x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup></I>?
<LI>(b) What are the quotient and remainder when <I>x<sup>10</sup>+x<sup>7</sup>+x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup></I>
is divided by <I>x<sup>8</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+x+1</I>? 
<LI>(c) What is the product of <I>x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+1</I> and <I>x<sup>5</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup></I> modulo
  <I>x<sup>8</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+x+1</I>?
</UL>
<p><LI>Pick two random 8-bit values, <I>x</I> and <I>y</I>, write them in
  hexadecimal, with the only condition being that the number of "1
  bits" in each of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> must be between 3 and 6 bits
  (inclusive). Next, treating these as elements from <I>GF(2<sup>8</sup>)</I> (using
  the "AES modulus" of <I>m(x)=x<sup>8</sup>+x<sup>4</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>+x+1</I>), calculate the
  product of <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> -- show your work, and for full credit do
  all operations in binary representation (don't write out
  polynomials)! [<I>This problem and the next two are "create
      your own unique problem" problems. If you pick random values,
      then your values and your problem/solution will be different
      from everyone else's in the class.</I>]
<p><LI>Select a random 8-bit value (with at least 2 bits set to 1), and show
  the work required to find the AES S-box mapping for this value. Your
  final result should agree with the look-up table given in Table
  5.2. [<I>Hint: You can select your 8-bit value so that it is
      "easy to invert," but you should still have some randomness in your
      selection -- don't just pick the easiest value.</I>]
<p><LI>For this question, you are to work through the first four steps of AES
encryption (the initial AddRoundKey followed by the first 3 steps in
round 1). Show enough work to demonstrate how you calculated the
result of each step.
<UL><LI>(a) Pick a 16 byte plaintext and 16 byte key. You can 
  pick some random values, or write down some pattern, but don't use
  anything obvious -- I don't want to see any two students with the
  same values! Write down your values in the <I>4&#215;4</I> state matrix
  form used in the book.
<LI>(b) Perform the initial AddRoundKey step on the values from (a).
<LI>(c) Perform SubBytes on the result of part (b).
<LI>(d) Perform ShiftRows on the result of part (c).
<LI>(e) Perform MixColumns on the result of part (d).
