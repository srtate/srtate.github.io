    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 5 - Due Thursday, April 7</H1>

<OL><LI>ElGamal encryption was described in Section 10.2 of the textbook. In
this problem, you are to explore how ElGamal measures up in terms of
the formal security models we discussed.
<UL><LI>(a) It is impossible for "textbook RSA" (meaning RSA without
  any padding or randomness) to be IND-CPA
  secure. Why is that, and does ElGamal have the same problem?
<LI>(b) Let <I>(C<sub>1</sub>,C<sub>2</sub>)</I> be an ElGamal ciphertext, computed as shown
  in Figure 10.3 (page 293). Write out formulas (in terms of <I>alpha</I>,
  <I>k</I>, <I>Y<sub>A</sub></I> and <I>M</I>) for <I>alpha&#183;C<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>Y<sub>A</sub>&#183;C<sub>2</sub></I>, where 
  operations are preformed mod <I>q</I>.
<LI>(c) What result would be produced if you ran fake ElGamal
  ciphertext <I>(alpha&#183;C<sub>1</sub>,Y<sub>A</sub>&#183;C<sub>2</sub>)</I> through the ElGamal
  decryption function?
<LI>(d) Use these observations to create an attack algorithm that
  wins the CCA game against ElGamal. In addition to describing the
  algorithms, remember to analyze the advantage of your adversary in
  this game.
</UL>
<EM>As an aside, the message you should learn from this problem is that
textbook RSA cannot be IND-CPA secure, much less IND-CCA secure. ElGamal in
fact does turn out to be IND-CPA secure, but it is not IND-CCA secure.</EM>
<P>
<LI>Consider two 1024-bit large primes <I>p</I> and <I>q</I> such that <I>n=pq</I> is a
2048-bit modulus that we want to use for RSA. Since the exponent <I>e</I>
in RSA is a public value (it is part of the public key) it is common
to use small, specially chosen values of <I>e</I> so that encryption is
particularly fast.
<UL><LI>(a) In the "exponentiation by repeated squaring" algorithm, if <I>e</I>
  is chosen randomly (a random 2048-bit exponent), what is the average
  number of modular multiplications that would need to be performed to
  do an RSA encryption?
  (<I>Hint: If you look at the recursive version of this
    algorithm, at each level of recursion either 1 or 2 modular
    multiplications must be performed, depending on whether the
    exponent at that level of recursion is even or odd. The
    probability that the exponent is even is exactly the
    probability that a specific bit of the original, random exponent
    is 0, which should should be <I>(1)/(2)</I>.</I>)
<LI>(b) If we always use <I>e=3</I>, how many modular multiplications are
  needed for an RSA encryption? How much faster is this than the
  general case from part (a)?
<LI>(c) What restrictions does the modulus <I>n</I> (or the primes <I>p</I> and
  <I>q</I>) need to satisfy in order to use <I>e=3</I>?
<LI>(d) If we always use <I>e=65537</I>, how many modular multiplications are
  needed for an RSA encryption? How much faster is this than the
  general case from part (a)?
<LI>(e) What restrictions does the modulus <I>n</I> (or the primes <I>p</I> and
  <I>q</I>) need to satisfy in order to use <I>e=65537</I>?
<LI>(f) (Extra Credit!) Alice would like to send the same message <I>M</I> to
  three different recipients, all of whom have their own RSA public
  keys with 2048-bit moduli and a fixed exponent <I>e=3</I>. In other
  words, she sends out messages <I>c<sub>1</sub>=M<sup>3</sup>mod n<sub>1</sub></I>, <I>c<sub>2</sub>=M<sup>3</sup>mod n<sub>2</sub></I>, and <I>c<sub>3</sub>=M<sup>3</sup>mod n<sub>3</sub></I>. Eve captures these messages, and can
  decode the message <I>M</I> even without knowing the private keys. How?
  (<I>Hint: The Chinese Remainder Theorem from Section 8.4 is
    very useful!</I>) If the messages are padded independently with OAEP
  before encryption with RSA, does this fix this flaw? Explain.
</UL>
<p>
<LI>The "man-in-the-middle attack" for the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
(described starting on page 290) is a serious problem that stems from
the fact that Alice cannot guarantee that the message she sends to Bob
is the same as the message that Bob receives. Consider using a public
web site (like a discussion forum) as follows: Alice and Bob post
their values <I>Y<sub>A</sub></I> and <I>Y<sub>B</sub></I> on this site, and they retrieve the other
side's value from this site. Alice and Bob can also check the web site
(from different hosts if they want to disguise their identity) to see
if the correct value is being provided by the public web site. Does
this solve the problem? Address issues such as how you identify
another user, whether the communication link that Alice and/or Bob
uses is compromised, etc.
<p>
<LI>Imagine that a very powerful <EM>passive adversary</EM> is capturing all
Internet traffic and archiving it (perhaps in a big data center in
Utah) in case it is useful at some point in the future. At some point
a computer is compromised, and all data from
that computer is retrieved, including secret keys. If communications
that were archived from 
<EM>prior to this compromise</EM> remain secure, and can't be decrypted even with
knowledge of the stolen secret keys, we say the communication protocol
that was used has <EM>forward secrecy</EM>. Consider the following two
methods for an encrypted session:
<DL><DT><B>Using RSA.</B><DD> At the beginning of the year a server generates an
  RSA keypair and sends the public key to all clients (this is a
  reliable key distribution, and can't be corrupted). To establish an
  encrypted session later in the year, the client generates a random AES
  session key, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends the
  ciphertext to the server. The server then uses its private key to
  decrypt the session key, and then the client and server send all
  subsequent communication encrypted by AES with the session key.
<DT><B>Using Diffie-Hellman.</B><DD> In this scenario, there are no
  pre-distributed keys, and the client and server perform a
  Diffie-Hellman key exchange as shown in Figure 10.1 in the
  textbook. After the key exchange, both client and server take the
  least significant 256 bits of the generated shared secret and uses
  it as an AES key for the rest of the session.
</DL>
For each of these two methods, answer the following questions (with
justification - if it is insecure, your justification should include
a clear description of how to break the security).
<UL><LI>(a) Does the method have forward secrecy?
<LI>(b) Is the method secure against man-in-the-middle (active) attacks?
</UL>
<p><LI>Consider the elliptic curve <I>E<sub>13</sub>(1,1)</I>; that is, the curve is
  defined by <I>y<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>3</sup>+x+1</I> with a modulus of <I>p=13</I>. 
<UL><LI>(a) Determine all of
  the points in <I>E<sub>13</sub>(1,1)</I>. (<I>Hint: Start by calculating the
    right-hand side of the equation for all values of <I>x</I>.</I>)
<LI>(b) Compute the sum <I>(4,2)+(8,12)</I> in <I>E<sub>13</sub>(1,1)</I>.
