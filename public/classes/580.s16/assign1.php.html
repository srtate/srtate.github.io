    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 1 - Due Tuesday, February 2</H1>

<P><P><P><EM>Note: Remember that one of the main goals of this class is to
  develop your skills in reasoning about security, so show your work
  and explain your reasoning on all problems - for homework problems,
  your thought process is as important as the final answer!</EM>
<OL><LI>This question looks into the problem of malware inside point-of-sale
systems (systems that you use to pay for a purchase in a store), which
is a huge problem for retailers.
<OL><LI>Do some Internet research and learn how traditional (magnetic
  stripe) credit card point-of-sale systems work, and draw a
  diagram of how a credit card purchase works in such a system. You
  don't have to be very detailed, but show all the major components
  (including the magstripe reader, the merchant's computers/network,
  and the payment authorizer) and indicate
  whether sensitive data is encrypted in each system or communication link.
<LI>Read about the infamous 2013 attack on
Target stores in the following two stories
<UL><LI><A HREF="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/">A First Look at the Target Intrusion, Malware</A> -- Krebs on Security
<LI><A HREF="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-closer-look-at-the-target-malware-part-ii/">A Closer Look at the Target Malware, Part II</A> -- Krebs on Security<BR></UL>
Write a brief summary (less than a page), being careful to use
proper terminology. In particular, what <EM>assets</EM> were compromised
in this <EM>attack</EM>? (Hint: Think broadly: stolen information is
certainly an asset, but so is company infrastructure.) For these
assets, what are <EM>confidentiality</EM>, <EM>integrity</EM>, and
<EM>availability</EM> goals, and were they compromised? Where was a
<EM>vulnerability</EM> used as an <EM>attack vector</EM>? (This is
complex: there were certainly multiple attack vectors, some of which
are not publicly known - just summarize the ones described in the
stories referenced above.) Describe specifically where the adversary
(malware) was in your picture from part (a).
<LI>Find information on how newer, chip-card, point-of-sale systems work,
and give a modified version of your diagram from part (a) showing this
newer system. Would an adversary in the same position as in part (b)
be successful in the newer system? Explain why or why not.
</OL>
<p><LI>Textbook, page 56, Problem 2.1.
<p><LI>In this problem, we generalize the affine Caesar cipher from the
  previous problem to work
  over bytes (with values <I>0..255</I>) rather than letters of the
  alphabet.
<OL><LI>If we did all operations mod 256 instead of mod 26, describe
  which keys <I>[a,b]</I> (where <I>0 &lt;= a,b &lt;= 255</I>) would be valid and
  which would be invalid.
<LI>What if we performed operations mod
  257. What are the invalid keys now?
</OL>
<p><LI>For this problem, you are to experiment with recognizing English
  text in a program, using that to break by brute force an affine cipher with operations
  performed mod 256 (as in part (a) of the previous problem). It turns
  out that almost all English text files are made up of pure ASCII
  characters, and satisfy the following three properties:
<UL><LI>All ASCII characters have values between 0 and 127 (inclusive).
<LI>Between 13% and 18% of the characters are a space.
<LI>Between 8% and 12% of the characters are an 'E' (upper or
  lower case).
</UL>
 On the
  class web page with this assignment, you will find example encryption code in
  C++, Java, and Python (with the plaintext missing) as well as a stub
  for each of these languages that defines your challenge ciphertext
  as a string constant.
Answer the following questions:
<OL><LI>How many valid keys are there for this cipher (i.e., what is the
  size of the keyspace)?
<LI>When you try all valid keys with the challenge ciphertext, how many keys result in decrypted plaintext that satisfies all
  three of the "typical English message" properties listed above?
<LI>What is the plaintext for this message?
</OL>
<p><LI>Professor Alice had to leave town on a clandestine mission
  before sending in the final grade for student Mallory, who is taking her
  class pass/fail. She arranges to use a one-time pad, as described on
  pages 47-48, giving the one-time pad key to the registrar (Bob) before
  she leaves. Finally, she sends a message to the registrar that gives
  Mallory's final grade. Mallory can intercept and modify the message,
  and while she doesn't know exactly what the plaintext is (and
  obviously doesn't know the key) she knows that it starts with the
  plaintext word "fail." Mallory intercepts the ciphertext message
  "<CODE>SXMHYOCZWITVBLA</CODE>".
What can she replace this with so that the plaintext message that Bob
decrypts starts with the word "pass" rather than "fail?"
<p><LI>Textbook, page 81, Exercise 3.2
<p><LI>Textbook, page 82, Exercise 3.5
<p><LI>Consider a company in which only the company president (Alice) has the
combination to the safe, but in case something happens to Alice she
would like it so that her two vice-presidents, Bob and Carol, can
learn the combination if they work together (this is a form of "key
escrow"). The combination can be specified in 64 bits, so they will
use DES to accomplish this. Alice shares a secret key <I>K<sub>AB</sub></I> with
Bob  and a secret key <I>K<sub>AC</sub></I> with Carol, but can't just encrypt the
combination with <I>K<sub>AB</sub></I> or <I>K<sub>AC</sub></I> because then either one could
decrypt the safe's combination without cooperating with the
other. Devise a solution so that Alice can leave a ciphertext with
them so that they can decrypt the combination if and only if they
cooperate with each other.
<P>Describe your solution carefully, saying exactly what operations Alice
must perform to create the ciphertext, and the operations Bob and
Carol will use to decrypt the ciphertext and learn the safe's
combination. Use clear, mathematical notation (so, for example,
<I>E(K<sub>AB</sub>,M)</I> uses DES to encrypt message <I>M</I> using key <I>K<sub>AB</sub></I>). 
In your description clearly state how large the ciphertext is.
