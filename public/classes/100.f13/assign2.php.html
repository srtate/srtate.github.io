<h2><span>Homework 2 - Teach Me About Fractions - Due Wed, Oct 2</span></h2>

<p>In this homework, you are to pull together a lot of
the pieces that we have been creating in the lab exercises to create a
simple math tutor program that teaches kids how to add
fractions.  Your target audience is kids in 5th or 6th grade, so
all the numbers that you work with should be small (one or two digits)
- that means that the "number stamping" scripts that you
wrote in the labs are perfect for this tutor program!</p>
<p></p><p>Here's the
basic idea: You should create a BYOB program where you have a
"teacher sprite" who will explain the process of finding
common denominators and adding fractions to kids, with examples, and
then challenge the kids with problems.  This is an open-ended
assignment:  There are minimum requirements that everyone must
satisfy (to get 85 out of the 100 possible points), and then there are
plenty of extras that can be added on to get the remaining 15
points.  The extras are limited only by your creativity, but I
give some suggestions below.  The following is an example of what
this program might look like while it is running:</p><p><img height="360" src="pics/HW2-image.png"
width="480"></p><p>This uses the digit stamping code
to write the numbers on the board (the digit stamping code comes from
Lab 3); it uses the pen and movement commands to draw the lines (like
we did in Lab 2) in the fractions separating numerator and
denominator; and finally it uses the "ask" block to ask
the student a challenge question (like we did in the last part of Lab
4). After the student gives an answer, the program can check their
answer by using the "common denominator" block from Lab
4.  Based on this example, we can describe the minimum
requirements of this assignment.</p><h3>Minimum Requirements (worth 85
points)</h3><p>Your program should do at least
the following:</p><ul><li>Include a "teacher
  sprite" that gives a little tutorial about how fractions are
  added, and then challenges the student with some
  questions.  For the minimum requirements, you only need to ask
  students to find lowest common denominators.</li><li>You should use the "stamp digit"
  block and associated two-digit stamping code from Lab 3 to write
  numbers on the screen both during the tutorial phase of the program
  and in the question/challenge phase.  It should stamp out
  fractions "nicely", meaning that single digit values
  should only stamp one digit (no leading zero!), and numerator and
  denominator should line up (so if you have a one digit number over a
  two digit number, the one digit number will be centered over the two
  digit number).</li><li>Your program
  should ask at least 3 questions - for the minimum requirements these
  can be "hard coded", meaning that the program has the
  fractions built in and asks the same questions every
  time.</li><li>Your program should check
  the answer given by the student against the correct lowest common
  denominator, and let them know whether they got it right.  You
  should also count the number of correct and incorrect
  answers.</li><li>At the end of the
  question phase, use a "say" block to tell the student
  how many of his or her answers were right and how many were
  wrong.</li></ul><h3>Suggestions for Enhancements (worth
  15 points)</h3><p>Once you have a program
  that satisfies the minimal requirements, you can think of ways to
  make the program nicer.  Some suggestions are given below, but
  you are by no means limited to these ideas:</p><ul><li>Make a nice
    background for the tutor program, so it looks like you're in
    a classroom.</li><li>Add sounds or
    animations for when students get answers right or
    wrong.</li><li>Ask questions beyond
    what the lowest common denominator is - in fact, you could go all
    the way up through asking them to find the final sum of the two
    fractions.</li><li>Generate challenge
    problems at random.  To really do this well, you need to be
    careful about how you generate the problems.  For example,
    you want all the values the student works with to be reasonably
    small two digit numbers - having the student come up with the
    lowest common denominator of fractions with denominators 14 and 15
    is not good (the lowest common denominator would be 210).  To
    think about ways to do this, think about the math from Lab 4:
     first pick a random number in the range 1..8 to be the
    greatest common divisor of your two denominators, then pick small
    multipliers for the two denominators.  So you might generate
    a GCD of 4, multipliers of 2 and 3, so your two denominators are 8
    and 12 (that have a lowest common denominator of 24).  You
    might have to experiment with this a little to get a technique
    that you like.  Also consider that when you pick the
    numerators, your challenge fractions really should be in lowest
    terms (so, for example, don't use 6/8).  A fraction is
    in lowest terms when the GCD of its numerator and denominator are
    1.</li></ul><h3>Hints</h3><p
   >Here are some hints for you in this
    assignment:</p><ul><li><b>Do not wait until the
      last minute!</b>  I'm giving you a little
      over two weeks for this assignment, and that's not because
      I want you to ignore it for 15 days and try to get it done on
      the 16th day.  If you don't start right away and pace
      yourself, you will not be able to get this
      done.</li><li>You should start off with
	solutions that you're sure work for the previous
	labs.  If you aren't confident in the code you
	wrote, do the solution walkthroughs that have been provided so
	that you build good solutions.</li><li>Use the "Import Project" feature in the
	"File" menu of BYOB to merge solutions that are
	stored in different files together.  (Note that
	it's tempting to export and import sprites rather than
	entire projects, but there are some problems with doing that
	in BYOB - stick with importing projects and you should be
	fine.)</li><li>Start by extending
	the number stamping block to create a fraction stamping
	block.  This should take two parameters, a numerator and
	denominator, and stamp it out as a fraction, complete with
	separating line and proper formatting for single/double digit
	numbers.  Test it thoroughly so you're sure it
	works, and then after that point you can use your block and
	not worry about the stamping process any more!</li><li
	>Extending the idea of the last hint:
	Create your own blocks whenever you have some actions that you
	want to abstract, so you can forget the details.  This
	really does make your programming work much, much easier. For
	example, you have to ask three questions - these should not
	duplicate the same question-asking code three times! Define a
	single "quiz the student" block, and call it three
	different times with different parameters.</li><li
	>Plan out your work:  Write a little
	script (like a "script" for a play, not a
	"script" meaning a program!) and plan for your
	tutor program before you start coding things up.  You
	don't want to be coding and realize that you don't
	like the way your tutor program is shaping up, and then have
	to throw out all that work.  It's like the old
	carpenter's saying: "measure twice, cut
	once".  Throwing out a program and starting over
	isn't as expensive as a carpenter wasting wood, but why
	give yourself extra work?</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p
