<h1><center>Reading Reflection Information and Sample</center></h1>

<P><P><P>For each chapter that you are assigned from the book
<I>Blown to Bits</I>, you are
required to fill out a "reading
reflections" survey. The questions are generic, and
are not specific to the particular chapter or even this particular
book. They are, in fact, the kinds of questions you should be thinking
about as you read any serious writing, as these questions give you an
opportunity to reflect on and carefully think about what you are
reading. Don't just carelessly jot things down to
"get it done!" If you honestly
think about and answer these questions, it will help you make sense of
the material. Learning is largely about making connections between new
concepts and the things you already know, and these questions are
designed to help you do that. Try these questions when you have reading
assignments in other classes as well -- you might be surprised by how
much it helps!
<P>Like everything you produce in this class (and in life!), presentation
counts. Proper English, including spelling, punctuation, and grammar,
is important. However, these aren't formal essays, so
you don't need to think about multi-paragraph structure
and "thesis statements" and that
sort of thing. Write clearly so that what you want to say comes
through, and make your points in a logical way, but
that's the only requirement that I impose on
"structure."
<P>The seven questions that are on the reading reflection are given
below, with some sample answers so that you can see the level of
answer that I am expecting. Your goal should be to have answers of
similar depth to those given below, although this will vary somewhat
-- sometimes you might have a lot to say about how the reading
relates to your personal experiences, and other times there might not
be much.  That's expected and OK. The answers below are for Chapter 8
in <I>Blown to Bits</I> -- we won't get that far in the book, so
you won't be assigned a reading reflection on that chapter.  One final
comment on the <I>Blown to Bits</I> book: a lot of students in this
class are fascinated by technology, and focus on technical aspects
that are described in the book, but that is <EM>not</EM> the main focus of this
book! The book only talks about technologies for the purpose of
discussing how they have changed human lives. For example, if you
think the main point of Chapter 4 is to describe how Google works,
you've missed the point -- it's about the power wielded by search
companies when they control what information they identify for a user
and and what information they don't. For every chapter in this book,
keep in mind that it's about people, not technology.
<H2><A NAME="1">Sample Reading Reflection Answers</A></H2>
<OL><LI>What are the main points of this reading (focus on
concepts, ideas, and theme, not on individual facts)?
<P>In Chapter 8 of <I>Blown to Bits</I> ("Bits in the Air: Old
Metaphors, New Technologies, and Free Speech"), the authors discuss
regulations on radio and wireless technologies, where these
regulations include both technological regulations and content
regulations. The authors describe how radio technologies evolved, from
the late 1800's to today, with an important part of this development
happening between 1910 and 1930. In those days, radio technology was
just being invented, and the airwaves were somewhat chaotic without
regulation. At first, regulation was introduced to allocate parts of
the radio spectrum for technical reasons -- to avoid
interference. Not long after that, regulations on content emerged,
with the argument that 1st Amendment free speech rights didn't have
free reign in such a limited resource (limited because, at the time,
technology didn't make efficient use of airwaves and available
frequencies). Because of the scarcity of the resource, licenses to use
it were reserved for broadcasters that worked "in the public
interest." This is the historical background for current content
regulations against profanity, nudity, etc. Putting these regulations
in this historical context is interesting, but unlike the rest of the
book, this chapter went beyond discussion of facts and
historical context into some pretty blatant advocacy for a particular
position: removing almost all regulations on wireless/radio use. The
authors do effectively make the case that the original arguments about
resource scarcity no longer apply in light of today's better
technology, but it's a logical leap to go from there to saying that
the only sensible approach now is to remove all the regulation. While
there are certainly some good arguments for less regulation, the
authors didn't make a very good case -- the writing comes across as
whining from technologists who think they should be allowed to do
whatever they want. A little less whining and a little more logical
argument would have made this a better chapter.
<LI>Was anything unclear or confusing to you?
<P>As mentioned in my summary, I don't think the
author's made a convincing argument that the solution
is doing away with regulation. Did I miss how they connected these
pieces?
<LI>What was new to you, and did it change the way you think
about or perceive things?
<P>The historical context was interesting, and I hadn't
been aware of how chaos in radio development led to the FCC and
associated regulations. The discussion of how technology has advanced
while policy and regulation have not -- resulting in regulations
relevant for 80 year-old technology but not so relevant to today -- made
me think about what would be sensible from a policy standpoint with
today's technology. The book pushed one particular view
of what would be sensible, but it's worth thinking
about other approaches.
<LI>Was there anything you would like to explore
further or find out more about?
<P>Smart technologies for radio sound interesting, such as software-defined
radios and cognitive radios. It would be interesting to compare how
much capacity was available with 1930's technology
(when "scarcity" arguments led to
regulation) versus what could be done with today's
technology. Is it 10 times greater today? 1000 times greater? It would
be interesting if this could be quantified.
<LI>Describe at least one connection between
the reading and topics from outside class (other classes, news stories
you've seen, etc.)?
<P>It was not very long ago that Janet Jackson's
"wardrobe malfunction" at the 2004
Super Bowl caused a big controversy, resulting in a fine of over half a
million dollars being levied against CBS by the FCC. This is exactly
the kind of content regulation that is discussed in this chapter, and
is based on decades old arguments that no longer make sense. The
technological advancements that make better and better use of airwaves
is also apparent from the way smartphone speed keeps increasing (from
1x to 3G to 4G and 4G/LTE). It's difficult to see how
scarcity of the resource can be a problem when current technology can
deliver multiple megabits per second to thousands of cell phones
simultaneously.
<LI>Give at least one specific example of an aspect
or experience in your personal life that is related to the reading.
<P>The chapter lists quite a few recent innovative uses of wireless
transmission, including WiFi, car lock/unlock remotes, Bluetooth, cell
phones, wireless handsets for home phones, and wireless game
controllers. I have used all of these technologies, so my life has
clearly been affected by innovation in wireless devices. The role of
regulation in limiting further wireless innovation is important to the
technologies that might be part of my life in the future.
<LI>Is there anything else you think would be relevant
for the class discussion of this reading?
<P>Are there other arguments for regulations on wireless transmission?
Assuming we don't want complete deregulation, what are
reasonable regulations in light of current technology?
