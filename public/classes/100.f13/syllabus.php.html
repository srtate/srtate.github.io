<P><P><B>Prerequisites:</B>
None.
<P><P><B>Catalog Description:</B>
A broad-based introduction to key concepts and principles of computer
science.  Exploration of seven big ideas of computing: creativity,
abstraction, data, algorithms, programming, the Internet, and impact
of computing.
<P><P><B>Who This Course is For:</B> This course is for two types of
students: non-majors who want to learn more about computing and
computer science, and as an optional pre-major course for computer
science majors who are just beginning and haven't taken the
traditional first computer science class (CSC 130).  The course is
designed so that students build problem solving and critical thinking
skills related to computing (i.e., "computational thinking" skills)
that are becoming vital 21st century skills across a wide variety of
interests and disciplines.  For beginning computer science majors, the
foundational skills built in this course are designed to improve
success in later computer science courses.
<P><P><B>Full Course Description:</B> This course is part of a national
initiative to create a new course covering computer science principles
that can be offered to a broad audience and can provide a consistent
experience for students at both the university level and the high
school level through an AP class. The "CS Principles Project" (see
<A HREF="http://www.csprinciples.org">http://www.csprinciples.org</A>) is
sponsored by the College Board and the National Science Foundation, with
partners and advisors from universities and high schools.  The CS
Principles Project describes the goals of this course as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>Computer Science: Principles</EM> is designed to introduce students to the
central ideas of computer science, to instill ideas and
practices of computational thinking, and to have students engage in
activities that show how computing changes the
world. The course is rigorous and rich in computational
content, includes computational and critical thinking skills, and
engages students in the creative aspects of the field. Through both its
content and pedagogy, this course aims to appeal to a broad audience.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not a "computer literacy" class or a "computer
programming" class, although at the end students will have a better
understanding of how computers work and will have gained some
experience in computer programming.  Rather, this class is about how
to think about problems and solutions in a world that is increasingly
data-rich and reliant on computing tools and techniques.
<P><P><B>Student Learning Outcomes:</B> 
Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to
<OL><LI>use programming and computing tools in creative expression,
creating and analyzing artifacts (creativity);
<LI>devise and use multiple levels of abstraction in computation,
including the use of models and simulations to raise and answer
questions (abstraction);
<LI>use computing to examine large datasets and facilitate exploration
in order to gain insight and knowledge (data);
<LI>devise, express, and evaluate algorithms for solving computational
problems (algorithms);
<LI>create and evaluate a correct program to implement an algorithm,
using abstraction to manage complexity (programming);
<LI>explain characteristics of the Internet and systems built on it,
including issues of cybersecurity and privacy (Internet);
<LI>analyze beneficial and harmful effects of computing, connecting
computing to economic, social, and cultural contexts and innovations in
other fields (impact).
</OL>
<P><P><B>Textbook and Readings:</B>  This class is organized around readings
and lab exercises that are distributed through the class web page.  We
will regularly discuss readings from the following book, which is
available online for free, or you can purchase a hardcopy if you prefer:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Hal Abelson, Ken Ledeen, and Harry Lewis.  <EM>Blown to Bits: Your
    Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion.</EM>
  Addison-Wesley, 2008 (online version available at
  <A HREF="http://www.bitsbook.com">http://www.bitsbook.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</B> This class will meet for two
lectures and one mixed lecture/lab per week.  Lectures will be
interactive, with discussions both in small groups and with the class
as a whole.  Students are expected to prepare for class by completing
assigned readings, and to actively respond and participate in class
discussions.  Students will demonstrate achievement of learning
outcomes through the following work: two in-class exams (mid-term and
final), readings and associated reading reflection exercises, lab
exercises, homeworks, and a final project.  These are described in
more detail below:
<P><P><I>Exams:</I> The mid-term and final exam will cover topics
discussed in lecture and emphasized through lab exercises and
homeworks.  Questions will cover all 7 of the defined student learning
outcomes.
<P><P><I>Readings:</I> Most readings will come from the book <EM>Blown
  to Bits</EM>, although other short readings will be required as well.
Students are expected to <EM>complete each major reading assignment
  at least 24 hours in advance of the class discussion</EM> and complete a
few "reading reflection" questions online in Blackboard.  This will
give the instructor time to review your responses and guide discussion
according to class comments and questions from the reading reflection.
For dates of class discussions and information on readings, students
should regularly check the schedule on the class web site.
<P><P><I>Lab Exercises:</I> Lab exercises involve programming in BYOB, a
programming system that was developed at the University of California
at Berkeley, or some other relevant programming language.  Student
work products include programs that they create, or modifications of
programs provided by the instructor. Each lab exercise contains some
pre-lab reading (which students should read <EM>before</EM> coming to
lab), some self-test questions to check understanding of the pre-lab
reading, the actual activities to perform in the lab, and an
explanation of how the lab exercise and concepts fit into the bigger
picture of computer science. Lab activities will utilize
<A HREF="http://www.realsearchgroup.org/pairlearning/index.php"><EM>pair
    programming</EM></A>,
where pairs of students work together on a single computer, taking
turns as the <EM>driver</EM> and the <EM>navigator</EM>.
At the end of the lab, students will individually take an on-line quiz
to test how well they have mastered the concepts in that lab.
Exercises are concrete demonstrations of topics being discussed, and
each lab session will start with a mini-lecture on relevant topics and
an opportunity for students to ask questions about the pre-lab
reading.  The final lab sessions will be dedicated to guided work on
student projects.  Lab exercises are available on the class web site,
both under "Lab Exercises" and linked from the class schedule.
<P><P><I>Homeworks:</I> Homeworks consist of independent student work that
is less guided than lab work.  Some homeworks involve creating a
program and some involve written exercises and analysis, and often
include open-ended aspects in which students can demonstrate their own
particular creativity.  Students will typically have two weeks
to complete homework.  No homeworks will be given in the last month of
the semester, when students will be working on their projects.
<P><P><I>Project:</I> Students will work in teams of 2 or 3 people to
produce some creative software product (an animation, game, tool,
etc.), and will work on this project during the final month of the
semester.  At the end of the semester there will be a "project
showcase" in which students present and demonstrate their projects
for the class.  Students will vote on the projects, and the winning
project will receive a "Student's Choice Award."
<P><P><I>Optional "Story of the Day":</I> Students are encouraged to
follow technology news (from sources such as 
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/">ZDNet</A>,
<A HREF="http://technews.acm.org/">ACM Technews</A>, 
or the technology section of general news sources such as
the <A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/technology/index.html">New York Times</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/">CNN</A>, 
and <A HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/">USA Today</A>).
The first five minutes of
class may be used for discussion of current news that is relevant to
the class and identified by the students or by the
instructor. Students can email links of suggested stories to the
instructor for consideration as the "story of the day."
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each student work product will be
graded, and the student's final grade will be determined by assigning
each category of work a weighted score according to the following
distribution:

<P><P><I>Professionalism and Work Quality:</I> While the objectives of
this class deal with technical issues, students should at all times
produce high quality, neat, and grammatically correct work. Spelling
and grammar reflect substantially on your seriousness and
professionalism, and sloppy or grammatically incorrect work will
result in up to 10% being taken off the grade even if all technical
information is correct.
<P><P>The final weighted average will be assigned a letter grade according to
the following table (exact borderline cases will be given the higher
grade - for example, a student with a weighted average of 90 will earn
an A-).

"Schedule" area of the class web site.
<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B> Each student is required to abide by the
UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on all work in the course.
Refer to 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu">http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu</A>
or the UNCG Undergraduate Bulletin
for more information.  Some assignments and exercises may involve
teamwork, pair programming, or group discussion.  When portions of
these assignments or exercises are to be done individually, they will
be clearly marked as such, and work turned in should be entirely your
own.  On all work that you turn in, work or ideas that are not your
own should be clearly marked and a citation should be given (a list of
team members or collaborators, external references, etc.).
<P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> 
Attendance will be taken, and students may be
dropped from the course if they have more than three unexcused
absences.  The university allows for a limited number of excused
absences for religious observances - students who plan to take such an
absence should notify the instructor at least two weeks in advance so
that accommodations can be made (also see below for
"late work and makeup exams").
 It is the student's responsibility to obtain notes
from another student if they miss class.
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> Assigned work is due at the
beginning of class on the due date, and will not be accepted late.
Exams and in-class work must be done on the scheduled day, in class.
In cases of serious medical situations (which must be documented with
a doctor's excuse), some exceptions can be made.  Students with
planned absences, whether for university events, religious observance,
or other reason, are expected to make arrangements with the instructor
to turn in assignments or take exams before the scheduled date of the
assignment or test.
<P><B>Final Exam:</B>  The final exam will be held according to the
official UNCG Final Exam Schedule, which lists the time for this exam
as Wednesday, December 4, 12:00 - 3:00.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B> UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Accessibility
Resources and Services located in 215 Elliott University Center: (336)

<P><P><B>University Closings:</B>  If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Blackboard site for information about if and how the class will
proceed. 
<P><P><B>Commercial note-taking services:</B> Selling class notes for
commercial gain or purchasing such class notes in this or any other
course at UNCG is a violation of the University's Copyright Policy and
of the Student Code of Conduct.  Sharing notes for studying purposes,
or borrowing notes to make up for absences, without commercial gain,
are not violations.
