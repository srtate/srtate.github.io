<h2><span>Homework 1 - Making Beautiful Music</span></h2>
<h3>Due: Friday, Sept. 13</h3>
<p><span>This homework is simply stated, because it&rsquo;s open-ended and largely up to you. Here is what you have to do: Create a BYOB script that plays a song. That&rsquo;s it!</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>There is only one requirement: Your song can&rsquo;t be too short. It should play a minimum of 25 notes, and last at least 15 seconds. If you don&rsquo;t have any experience with music, below is enough information for you to write a script to play Mary Has a Little Lamb, which satisfies these minimal requirements - but hopefully you can do more than that!</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The main purpose of this assignment is to have you investigate on your own and experiment with an area of BYOB that we have not looked at: sound. If you do this in a school lab, you should use headphones so that you can hear the sound generated by your scripts without disturbing others in the lab. Everything you need is located in the &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; category of the blocks palette, so experiment with the various blocks to see what they do.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>If you do </span><span>just</span><span>&nbsp;the minimum, you can expect at most a mid-B for a grade. To do better than that you must experiment and try different instruments and different effects. Maybe a drum riff? (Isn&rsquo;t it obvious that the way to spice up &ldquo;Mary Has a Little Lamb&rdquo; is to add a drum solo?) You should also look for sensible places to replace common sequences with custom blocks - most songs have some repetition in them, so this shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to do.</span></p><h3><span>A Brief Music Lesson</span></h3><p><span>You only have to know a little bit about music to complete this assignment. When you use the &ldquo;play note&rdquo; block, the first parameter is the note that should be played, represented as a number. &nbsp;This number is a scale of half-steps, but when you click on the number to change the note you get a picture of a keyboard. The following picture shows four notes labeled with their names (C, D, E, and G) and the corresponding number values.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><center><img height="142" src="pics/HW1-image00.png" width="234"></center></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>These four notes are all the notes used in the song &ldquo;Mary Had a Little Lamb&rdquo; - you can make that song by playing the following notes: E, D, C, D, E, E, E, (pause), D, D, D, (pause), E, G, G, (pause), E, D, C, D, E, E, E, E, D, D, E, D, C.</span></p><p><span></span></p>
