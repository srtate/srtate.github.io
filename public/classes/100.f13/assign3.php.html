<h2>Homework 3 &ndash; Fractal Designs &ndash; Due Wednesday, Nov. 6</h2>
<p>In Activity 3
    of Lab 9, you experimented with a recursively generated
    self-similar shape called a Sierpinski
    Triangle. In mathematics there are many such shapes that are known
    as "fractals," and
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">Wikipedia page
    on Fractals</a>
    has a good discussion with different examples (you aren't required
    to read this, but you might find it interesting). While fractals
    are often studied simply for the beauty of the drawings, there are
    practical uses too: at the bottom of the
    Wikipedia page is an example that shows a fractal construction of
    an artificial mountain - many game designers use fractals for
    generating realistic artificial landscapes for games, and due to
    the self-similarity of the structure the game can zoom in on this
    artificial structure at whatever scale is needed. In this
    homework, you will learn about some self-similar shapes that go
    beyond the Sierpinski Triangle that you saw in Lab 6, see some
    examples of where they occur both in nature and in design, and
    then experiment in BYOB with drawing some recursively-generated
    shapes.</p>
<p>Self-similar shapes and drawings can have a high level
  of symmetry and infinitely-detailed structure. Many societies and
  artists have found great beauty in fractal designs, and in
  particular many African geometric designs that are found in fabrics
  and in village design are based on fractals. This homework has a
  couple of initial activities that you should do before getting to
  the main part of the assignment. I have put dates on these
  activities to indicate when I will assume you have done them, so we
  can discuss these items briefly in class. However, you are
  encouraged to work faster than this so you have plenty of time to
  think about and work on the BYOB code.</p>
<p class="Standard"><i><u>Activity 1 (finish no later than
    Wednesday, October 23)</u></i>: Watch the video of
    the TED talk "Ron Eglash: The fractals at
    the heart of African designs"
    at
 <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_on_african_fractals.html">http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_on_african_fractals.html</a>. The
    video is 17 minutes, and you should spend at least 30 minutes
    thinking about the ideas and exploring fractals online.</p>

<p class="Standard"><i><u>Activity 2 (finish no later than
    Monday, October 28)</u></i>: Go through the online lesson on
    fractals and design
    at <a href="http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/index.html">http://csdt.rpi.edu/african/African_Fractals/index.html</a>,
    which should take about one hour to complete (that depends on how
    much time you spend playing with the
    applets).</p>
<p class="P5"><i><u>Activity
    3 (finish no later than Wednesday, November 6)</u></i>: You should
    create BYOB scripts to draw at least two of the fractals from the
    preceding online lesson, where the two should be chosen from the
    list at the end of this activity. How much time should this take?
    It could take anywhere from as little as one hour to as much as
    twenty very frustrating hours. If you get really stuck, seek
    help!</p>
<p class="P5">What's great about
    fractal drawings is that it takes very little code to draw very
    intricate shapes. The bad part is that for such a small amount of
    code, it can be very difficult to wrap your mind around. In Lab 9
    you created code to draw a Sierpinski Triangle. Let's walk through
    how to make a BYOB script to draw a Koch curve (the first example
    in the lesson above). This will give you another example to look
    at, think about, and possibly play around with on the computer
    before you have to make your own fractal drawing
    code.</p>
<p class="P5">The idea is fairly
    straightforward: we pass two parameters, for the size of the
    drawing and the number of levels of recursion to use. The base
    case is a 0 level Koch curve, and will just draw a single straight
    line of the specified length for the base case. At higher levels
    we make four segments, each of which is a Koch curve at a smaller
    level. Here's the code:</p>
<img src="pics/Koch-Def.png" />
<p class="P5">That's the entire recursive
    script, and all that's needed to draw Koch curves at whatever
    level of detail you want. There are a few things you really need
    to understand about this code which are not obvious at first
    glance &ndash; make sure you understand <i>why</i> each
    of these is important before you try writing your own fractal
    drawing code!</p>
<ul><li><p>All
    direction adjustments are relative adjustments and not absolute &ndash;
    in other words, in recursive code, always use "turn" blocks and
    never the "point in direction"
    block.</p></li>
<li><p>The "sub length" that is calculated depends on the fact that
    we're turning 60 degrees. If you had a different "seed shape" or
    even just a different angle in this shape, you'd need to solve a
    little trigonometry problem to get this right.</p></li>
<li><p>The sequence of turns should always leave the drawing sprite
    with the same direction that it started in &ndash; in other words, all
    turns should cancel out: in this case we have two counterclockwise
    turns of 60 degrees, which is exactly balanced by a clockwise turn
    of 120 degrees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You
    also need a driver script, and below is an example of a driver
    script that draws a level 0 Koch curve (remember, this is just a
    straight line) - it has to set the starting position and
    orientation, make sure the screen is cleared and the pen is down,
    and then uses the block we just defined to make the drawing. The
    output is shown to the right.</p>

<p class="P5">A level 0 Koch curve is very boring, of course. Here's
    what it looks like if we change the level parameter to 1, 2, 3, 4,

<p class="P5">Isn't that cool? Just a little
    bit of BYOB code can draw these amazingly intricate, symmetric,
    and infinitely detailed
    pictures!</p>
<p class="P5">Now for your
    assignment: You are to create BYOB scripts to draw two of the
    fractal designs described in the web lesson you followed for the
    previous activity, restricted to the ones listed below. I think it
    would be great if you chose one shape from the "fractals in
    nature" examples and one from the "African fractals" examples, but
    really any two will be OK. Here are the shapes you can choose
    from:</p>
