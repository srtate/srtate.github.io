<h3 class="mt-4">Special Note for Spring 2022</h3>

<p class="ml-4">
This is an in-person class, and certain policies and protections must
be followed to protect everyone during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
For more information on UNCG and class policies, please
see the <a href="syllabus.html">class syllabus.</a>
</p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Overview</h3>

      <p class="ml-4"> This class is all about the study of
algorithms, covering how to model real-world problems with precise
mathematical models, how to apply different algorithmic problem
solving techniques, how to analyze efficiency and reason about
correctness of algorithms, and how to communicate clearly about
algorithms. Student work will include theoretical analysis and proofs,
on-paper design, and programming solutions. <i>Expected background</i>
includes a solid mathematical background in discrete mathematics and
proof-writing (CSC 250 and CSC 350) and knowledge of data structures
(CSC 330). While you aren't expected to be an expert, you should have
working knowledge of asymptotic notation, recurrence relations, hash
tables, tree structures, graphs, and basic graph algorithms such as
search and path-finding algorithms.  </p>
      
<p class="ml-4"> By the end of this class, students will have studied
and worked with design techniques including divide-and-conquer,
dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and randomized
algorithms. Students will have seen a variety of powerful graph-based
modeling and optimization techniques, including shortest path and
max-flow algorithms. The final few weeks of the class will focus on
fundamental barriers to efficient algorithmic solutions, including the
study of NP-completeness and heuristic/approximation algorithms (both
for solutions and to understand limitations).  </p>
