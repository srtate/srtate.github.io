<h2><span>Homework 3 - Explore - Impact of Computing Innovations - Due Wed, Oct 29</span></h2>

<p> In this homework, you will explore a computing innovation in
depth, and create a project report with a visual component
(visualization, graphic, movie, ...). This assignment comes directly
from the College Board's draft of the AP Computer Science Principles
course &ndash; high school students taking the college-level AP CS
Principles class will do a similar assignment that is submitted as
part of their AP test.</p>

<p> The full description is in the following additional documents, extracted from College Board CS Principles documents:
<ul>
<li> <a href="CSP-PerformanceTask2.pdf">Explore Performance Assessment</a>, and</li>
<li> <a href="CSP-Rubric2.pdf">the grading rubric</a></li>
</ul>
(originals of both documents are available at <a
href="http://apcsprinciples.org/cs-principles-documents/">http://apcsprinciples.org/cs-principles-documents/</a>). Your
first task will be to select a computing innovation that will be the
topic of your report. For some suggestions, there are several
published lists of important innovations &ndash; here are a few: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://betaboston.com/news/2014/05/19/50-ways-that-mit-has-transformed-computer-science/">50 key MIT-related innovations</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/20-biggest-tech-innovations-of-my-lifetime-that-i-actually-use/">20 biggest tech innovations of my lifetime that I actually use</li>
<li><a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/10-greatest-technological-inventions-40511.html">10 greatest technological inventions</a></li>
<li><a href="https://compsci.lafayette.edu/homepage/top-30-innovations/">Top 30 innovations</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some tips: Don't pick an innovation that is too big or broad (like
"the computer"), because there's simply too much to be able to write
something meaningful and focused. Also, make sure it's a computer
innovation &ndash; some of those lists are broader than just computer or
digital technologies.</p>

<p>You are not restricted to these lists or to anything I have
mentioned, but if there is any question about whether a topic is
appropriate, please ask me. If you go off in a completely weird and
inappropriate direction without talking to me first, you run the risk
of a low grade.</p>
