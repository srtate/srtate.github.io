</OL>
<P>TEACHING METHODS AND ASSIGNMENTS FOR ACHIEVING LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
This class will meet twice per week for 75 minutes each meeting --
some class time will be traditional lectures, reviewing concepts and
tools that are useful for the senior project, but most class time will
be used for guided discussion, student presentations, and some team
meetings.  
<P>Students are expected to work in teams of 2-4 students and choose an
appropriate project or research topic in consultation with the
instructor.  Teams then do a short presentation that "pitches" the
idea to the instructor and the class.  While there is some flexibility
in project selection, students should keep in mind the "capstone"
nature of this class.  Projects should demonstrate that the students
have a working knowledge of basic and advanced concepts in computer
science and also demonstrate a reasonable knowledge of recent
developments in computer science. <EM>Each project should include
  non-trivial software development that has been approved by the
  instructor.</EM>
<P>With an approved project, students will proceed through a standard
sequence of software development stages, beginning with a requirements
analysis and specification, and concluding with a final evaluation.  A
full list of the 5 project stages is given in the "TOPICAL
OUTLINE/CALENDAR" section.  Before the completion of
each stage, there will be a presentation from each project that
previews the progress and results in that phase, for in-class
discussion and suggestions for refinement in completing that
development stage.  For
these intermediate stage presentations, team members will rotate
through as "presenter" for the team, and each student must make at
least two intermediate-stage presentations (for teams with 3 or 4
people this 
means that there will have to be multiple presentations on the same
stage).
<P><I>Reports:</I> Throughout the course of the semester, students will
be creating a cumulative project design and implementation report,
which will have one major section for each of the five stages on the
course calendar.  At each due date, students will turn in the
<EM>entire</EM> document, adding a new section for the current stage,
and completing any necessary revisions to previous stage reports.  The
entire report should be in <EM>a single PDF file</EM> that is emailed to
the instructor before the beginning of class on the due date.  A
"work log" should be submitted with the report (but as a separate
document) which summarizes team meetings and work performed for this
stage, focusing on problems encountered, decisions made, and
assignment of tasks to team members.  The instructor will print and
comment on the current stage and provide suggestions for
improvement.  These refinements should be made and include in the next
submission, and in doing so students may regain half of any points
deducted.
<P>At the end of the semester, the final deliverables for the project
are: the completed, cumulative <EM>project design and implementation
report</EM>,
a <EM>technical report</EM> that includes a self-contained one page
summary, suitable for putting on a web page, a <EM>display poster</EM>,
and an <EM>oral presentation</EM>.  For projects that aim to develop a
usable software system, the technical report must include a "user's
manual" that describes the system to an end-user.  In addition to the
team's project report, each member should individually turn in a short
summary of their own contributions and their own thoughts on teamwork
aspects of the project (specific guidelines will be provided).  The
final presentation should be a coordinated presentation in which each
team member speaks for at least 5 minutes on some aspect of the
project, highlighting their individual contributions toward the
project's success.
<P><P>EVALUATION AND GRADING: Students work on a single project throughout
the duration of this course, and their course grade is calculated
based on the grades for individual aspects and milestones.  The
project will be graded for content, correctness, quality of
presentation (oral and written reports), team work,
and the demonstration of the student's knowledge in the
computer science field.

<P><I>ETS Exam:</I> You must take the ETS exam (a standardized test of
undergraduate-level computer science knowledge) to pass this
course. However the scores that you receive for the ETS exam will not affect
your grade in this course. The Department of Computer Science will pay
the fee for the ETS exam, which will be given on <EM>Thursday,
  March 17</EM>.  Note that the ETS exam takes longer than the 75 minutes
allocated for this class -- the exact times for the exam will be
determined later to be compatible with student schedules.
<P><P>REQUIRED TEXTS/READING/REFERENCES:
Readings and references are project-specific, and will be determined
by project groups, with approval of the instructor.
<P><P>SPEAKING AND WRITING REQUIREMENTS: This is a writing intensive (WI)
and speaking intensive (SI) class, and students are required to write
multiple reports and give multiple presentations during the course of
the semester.  Several classes will be used to cover and discuss
best practices for technical communication (written and oral) during
the semester, and links to additional resources for writing and
speaking are in the "More Information" section of the class web
site.
<P>While the instructor will give feedback and assist
students in improving the quality of their written and oral
communication, students are advised that additional help is available
from the following university centers:
<UL><LI>The University Writing Center provides assistance to students in
writing tasks from organizing thoughts to the mechanics of effective
writing.  The Writing Center provides individual consulting for
students through either face-to-face or online sessions.  For more
information, please refer to the center's web site at
<A HREF="http://www.uncg.edu/eng/writingcenter/">http://www.uncg.edu/eng/writingcenter/</A>
<LI>The University Speaking Center provides tutoring and services that
help students improve their oral communication skills.  Consultants at
the Speaking Center can provide assistance in the preparation and
delivery of speeches, as well as assistance in developing group or
team communication skills.  For more information, their website is

<P>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY:
Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do.  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."  For information on the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy,
see
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>. 
<P>Students are encouraged and expected to work in teams, but individual
responsibilities should be planned and documented throughout the
phases of the project.
<P>Students will be making extensive use of external references for their
project, and should be vigilant in maintaining high standards with
regard to attribution and avoidance of plagiarism.  If there are
questions about how to deal with any such matters, the student should
discuss the matter with the instructor to make sure there are no
misunderstandings. 
<P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY: This class will not always have an organized class
meeting during the scheduled time, and some classes (particularly
during the implementation phase) will be left for team meetings and
individual consultation with the instructor.  However, when organized
meetings are scheduled, attendance is vital -- discussions, oral
presentations, and progress reports will have a strong impact on your
ability to complete the project.  You may be dropped from the course
for missing more than two meetings.  The university allows for a
limited number of excused absences for religious observances --
students who plan to take such an absence should notify the instructor
at least two weeks in advance so that accommodations can be made (also
see the late work policy at the end of this syllabus).
<P><P>FINAL EXAMINATION:
There will be no final examination in this class.  Final project
reports are due at the UNCG-scheduled final exam time (May 2 at noon).
<P><P>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Laptops can be both a benefit and a distraction in a classroom.  While
many students benefit from taking notes using a laptop, or having
access to outside class-related resources during class, other students
cannot resist the temptation of checking e-mail, chatting, or even
playing games during class time.  This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><B>Late Policy:</B> Late work will not be accepted.  Students with
planned absences, whether for university events, religious observance,
or some other reason, are expected to make arrangements with the
instructor to turn in assignments before the scheduled due
date.
<P><P>ADA STATEMENT:  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
