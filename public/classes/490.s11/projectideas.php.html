<h3>CSC 490 Project Information and Suggestions</h3>

<P><P><P><P>Some of you may come into this class with a very clear idea of what
you'd like to do for a project, and others may have not thought about
this at all.  Even if you have a general idea, flushing it out to a
set of specifics can be challenging.  The only real requirements are
that your project be approved by the instructor, and that it involve a
strong design component (so porting an existing application or fixing
bugs in an existing project wouldn't qualify).  As you consider
proposing a project topic, keep in mind the following suggestions.
<UL><LI><I>Make it relevant</I>: Don't treat this as just an assignment you
  have to do to fulfill a requirement -- try to do something that
  someone else would care about: a useful project that you can
  contribute as open source, an application or tool for a non-profit
  or a research group, a research study that answers a question
  that others might find interesting, ...
<p>
<LI><I>Make it something you think is cool</I>:  You're going to be
  spending a lot of time working on this project, and it's easier
  to get motivated for the amount of work required if it's something that really
  sparks your interest.
<p>
<LI><I>Use what you've learned</I>: One goal of this project is to
  bring together different things you've learned to create something
  interesting.  For example, you might use software engineering
  principles, data structure and algorithm design, grammars from
  theory of computing, user interface design, and maybe even things
  like artificial intelligence, security, networking, or operating
  systems.
<p>
<LI><I>Try to learn something new</I>: Maybe this is a time to
  learn a new language, like PHP or Python, or a time to learn a new
  framework/API, like Facebook or Google gadgets.  Don't go overboard
  though: taking on multiple new topics (like learning Objective-C and
  the Apple iPhone API) and trying to get a non-trivial application
  designed and written might be too much.
<p>
<LI><I>Be Realistic</I>: Remember that you've only got a single
  semester for all phases of development, from design through
  implementation and testing, and that you have only about 4 weeks for
  the main coding work.  There are lots of great ideas for cool
  software -- just make sure you can do what you propose.  The
  instructor can help talk you through what's involved in your project
  to determine if you're biting off too much for a single semester.
</UL>
<P>The following
are some project ideas to get you thinking -- including
specific projects, general ideas, and ways to find ideas.  This list
reflects some of my biases about what I find interesting, and you
shouldn't feel locked in to this list.  Hopefully it will get you
thinking though!
<UL><LI>Extend a previous project in interesting directions (e.g., last
  semester's project wireless signal propagation).
<p>
<LI>Create a user-friendly graphical interface for configuring and
  maintaining advanced filesystems.  Some advanced filesystems have
  been introduced recently:  zfs from Sun (for Solaris, ported to BSD,
  and available in a limited way in Linux) and btrfs for Linux
  (initiated by Oracle, and still in the very, very early stages).
  Administration of such a filesystem can be a challenge, so a
  well-designed GUI tool would be an excellent contribution.
<p>
<LI>Create an easy-to use encrypted "container" as a filesystem
  that can be used in Linux (and in Windows for an extra bonus!).
  Current encrypted filesystems in Linux (and Windows!) make you
  choose between either encrypting everything, but putting it in a
  fixed-size allocation, or encrypting individual files, which can
  grow inside the regular file system but expose directory structures
  and usually file names as well.  Using FUSE in Linux, you should be able to
  make a filesystem that is allocated as a single block (so file names
  and directories aren't exposed) and yet grows and maybe even shrinks
  with demand.
<p>
<LI>Develop a solid, easy-to-use, encrypted, incremental off-site
  backup system for Linux.  Some solutions do exist (such as
  <CODE>rsync.net</CODE> and others), so finding something unique and
  distinctive to do here might be a challenge.
<p>
<LI>Write an Eclipse plugin that does something interesting (for
  example, manages programming assignments and submissions for an
  intro programming class).
<p>
<LI>Write a "data merge" web application -- for example, manage
  keeping an online calendar in sync with multiple other calendars.
<p>
<LI>Work with a UNCG faculty member developing software for their
  research.
<p>
<LI>Write a social game based on a social networking framework like
  the Facebook API or OpenSocial.
<p>
<LI>Design and perform a research project exploring and comparing
  different game AIs (e.g., for a simple card game).
<p>
<LI>Make a cool iPhone or iPod Touch or gPhone (Google Android) 
application.
<p>
<LI>Develop the next cool web application that will make you <U><I>and
  your faculty mentor</I></U> a billion dollars (OK, just checking to see
  if you're paying attention).
<p>
<LI>Look through Google "<A HREF="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of
  Code</A>" projects for interesting ideas.
