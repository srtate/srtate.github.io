        <ol type="1">
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 7.6) [<em>How to “grade” your work (15 points - 5 for each part): Each of these is pretty simple on its own, but make sure all the parts are there. Be as specific as possible about the running time, ideally with specific bounds like <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span> for each part. Set the problem up by giving names to the problems that are combined with the operation under question as well as the result of the operation (1 point); then argue how you decide the combined language such as <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> in the first two below (2 points); and justify that this runs in polynomial time (1 point). Remember to have a conclusion for each part (1 point)! </em>]</p>
<p>Show <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is closed under union, concatenation, and complement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Union:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(L_3=L_1\cup L_2\)</span> for languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> that are both in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> be decided in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_1})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> be decided in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_2})\)</span> for constants <span class="math inline">\(k_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_2\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(k_3=\max(k_1,k_2)\)</span>, so both <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> are decided in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_3})\)</span>. To decide <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span>, given an input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> we first run the algorithm to decide whether <span class="math inline">\(w\in L_1\)</span> – if so we accept, because <span class="math inline">\(w\in L_3\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(w\not\in L_1\)</span> then we run the decision algorithm for <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> and accept if and only if <span class="math inline">\(w\in L_2\)</span> (reject otherwise). This clearly decides <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> and runs in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_3})\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(L_3\in P\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is closed under union.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Concatenation:</strong> Given any two languages <span class="math inline">\(L_1,L_2\in P\)</span>, the concatenation language <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ L_3=\{xy\,|\, x\in L_1\text{ and }y\in L_2\} \]</span></p>
<p>Given a string <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can test whether <span class="math inline">\(z\in L_3\)</span> by trying all possible “dividing lines” for the concatenation. In other words, every way of breaking up <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> into strings <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(z=xy\)</span>. For each possibility, we check whether <span class="math inline">\(x\in L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\in L_2\)</span>. If the deciders for <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> run in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_1})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_2})\)</span>, respectively, and we let <span class="math inline">\(k_3=\max(k_1,k_2)\)</span>, then each possible dividing line can be tested in <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_3})\)</span> time. There are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible “dividing lines”, so total running time to decide <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(n\cdot n^{k_3})=O(n^{k_3+1})\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(L_3\in P\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is closed under concatenation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Complement:</strong> Complement is the easiest one. Given an that decides some language <span class="math inline">\(L\in P\)</span> in some polynomial amount of time, say <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span>, we run the same algorithm but flip the outcome: accept when we would have rejected, and reject when we would have accepted. This decides <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span> time, so <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L}\in P\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is closed under complement.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 7.9) [<em>How to “grade” your work (8 points): The key to this problem, and really the only way to approach it, is the fact that you can brute-force this problem since there are only <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> possible triangles, and each possible triangle is easy to check. You do need to have both parts here though: bound the number of triangles by <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> (5 points – 3 points for the less-useful vague statement about a “polynomial number”, since you really should give the <span class="math inline">\(O(n^3)\)</span> value); then describe how each can be checked in polynomial time (2 points – it’s ok to be vague with “polynomial” here, since the exact polynomial will depend on the machine model, like TM versus other computer). You should conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\textit{TRIANGLE}\in P\)</span> (1 point). </em>]</p>
<p>The exercise asks to show that the following language is in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \textit{TRIANGLE} = \{\langle G\rangle\,|\, G
   \text{ contains a triangle} \}\]</span></p>
<p>A triangle is a set of 3 vertices that are all connected to each other. To decide <span class="math inline">\(\textit{TRIANGLE}\)</span> you can just check every set of three vertices to see if they form a triangle. Given a set of three vertices, it’s trivial to check if they form a triangle (there are just three edges to check for). Since there are only <span class="math inline">\({n \choose 3}=O(n^3)\)</span> possible triangles, this is clearly polynomial time. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\textit{TRIANGLE}\in P\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>[<em>How to “grade” your work (10 points): There are five parts that all must be here: You must clearly define what the certificate is (3 points), clearly define and algorithm for the verifier (2 points), justify that the certificate exists and is verified if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\langle x,k\rangle\in\textit{FACTOR}\)</span> (2 points), argue that the verifier is polynomial time (2 points), and conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\textit{FACTOR}\in NP\)</span> (1 point). </em>]</p>
<p>The problem asks to show that the following language is in <span class="math inline">\(NP\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \textit{FACTOR} = \{ \langle x,k\rangle\,|\, x \text{ is an integer that is divisible by an integer } y\in[2,k] \} \]</span></p>
<p>For any <span class="math inline">\(\langle x,k\rangle\in\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\textit{FACTOR}\)</span>, a certificate is just a number <span class="math inline">\(a\leq k\)</span> that is greater than 1 and is a factor of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (in other words, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a non-trivial factor <span class="math inline">\(\leq k\)</span>). Since this is the definition of <span class="math inline">\(\textit{FACTOR}\)</span>, such a value <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> exists if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\langle x,k\rangle\in\textit{FACTOR}\)</span>. The verifier is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(V=\)</span> "On input <span class="math inline">\(\langle\langle x,k\rangle,a\rangle\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Test whether <span class="math inline">\(a\in [2,k]\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Test whether <span class="math inline">\(a\,|\,n\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> divides evenly into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>If both pass, <em>accept</em>; otherwise, <em>reject</em>."</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is clearly polynomial time, and accepts if and only if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is a valid certificate (which exists if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\langle x,k\rangle\in\textit{FACTOR}\)</span>). Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\textit{FACTOR}\in NP\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
