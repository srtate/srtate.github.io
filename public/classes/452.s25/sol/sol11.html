    <p>Reminder about <a href="../browser.html">browser check</a> – you should see “OK” in script here: <span class="math inline">\({\mathcal O}{\mathcal K}\)</span></p>
      
   
        <ol type="1">
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 8.1) [<em>How to “grade” your work (10 points): Showing the equivalence of two models is an “if and only if” proof, so make sure you prove both directions. The first direction below is pretty simple, but needs to be there (3 points). The other direction has a little more nuance, and this is where the condition that <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\geq n\)</span> is important – make sure this is explicitly used in your proof! The main thing here is that you can’t get below <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> space on a single-tape TM, since that’s needed for the input, so that has to be added to the space taken on the work tape (thus “<span class="math inline">\(n+f(n)\)</span>” below). For this direction, use 3 points for including the direction, 2 points for having the sum, and 2 points for making use of <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\geq n\)</span>. </em>]</p>
<p>We will show that if an algorithm runs using <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space in either model, then it can run in <span class="math inline">\(O(f(n))\)</span> in the other model.</p>
<p>If we have an algorithm that uses <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space on a single-tape Turing machine, then we can create a two-tape read-only input TM as follows: First, copy the input from the read-only input tape to the second tape, and then run the single-tape TM algorithm using only the second tape. On this model, space is determined only by the space used by the second (work) tape, and since this is running the single-tape TM algorithm this is also <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space.</p>
<p>Going the other direction, if we have a two-tape TM with read-only input that uses <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space, we simulate that using a single-tape TM: We just do the multitape TM simulation from Section 3.2, where all moves on the first tape leave the tape contents the same (this make it “read-only”). Recall that in this simulation, the second tape contents are stored after the first tape contents, so if the two-tape TM uses <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space on the second tape, then the one-tape TM uses space <span class="math inline">\(n+f(n)\)</span>. The problem includes the condition that <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\geq n\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(n+f(n)=O(f(n))\)</span>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if an algorithm runs using <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> space in either model, then it can run in <span class="math inline">\(O(f(n))\)</span> in the other model. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\text{SPACE}(f(n))\)</span> is the same regardless of which model is used.</p></li>
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 8.4) [<em>How to “grade” your work: The first two of these are very simple, but being clear with the necessary components is important. These parts should be graded out of 5 points, similar to the closure properties of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> a couple of assignments back: Set the problem up by giving names to the languages involved (1 point); then argue how you decide the combined language such as <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> in the first part below (2 points); and justify that this uses polynomial space (1 point). Remember to have a conclusion for each part (1 point)! The last part (closure under star) is more complicated: You can’t just try every possible way of dividing the input into substrings to test, because there are exponentially ways to do this. The algorithm below is exponential time, but it re-uses space for each substring test so that it only takes polynomial space. This is a subtle but important point – make sure you understand it! The third part should be graded out of 8 points, with 5 points allocated as in the first two parts, and 3 points for the description of the algorithm. </em>]</p>
<p>Closure properties of PSPACE are proved below.</p>
<p><strong>Union:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> be languages in <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span>, decided using space <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_1})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{k_2})\)</span>, respectively. To decide <span class="math inline">\(L_3=L_1\cup L_2\)</span>, we first run the algorithm for <span class="math inline">\(L_1\)</span> and then the algorithm for <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span>, and accept if either of those does (reject otherwise). Since we can reuse space after the first algorithm completes, this decides <span class="math inline">\(L_3\)</span> in space <span class="math inline">\(O(\max(n^{k_1},n^{k_2}))\)</span>, which is polynomial. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(L_3\in\text{PSPACE}\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span> is closed under union.</p>
<p><strong>Complementation:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be some language in <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span>, so is decided in a polynomial amount of space - say <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span>. We run the same algorithm but flip the outcome: accept when we would have rejected, and reject when we would have accepted. This decides <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span> space, so <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L}\in \text{PSPACE}\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(\text{PSPACE}\)</span> is closed under complement.</p>
<p><strong>Star:</strong> Given a language <span class="math inline">\(L\in\text{PSPACE}\)</span> that is decided by some TM <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in a polynomial amount of space, say <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span>, we will define a recursive algorithm that decides <span class="math inline">\(L^{*}\)</span> in (roughly the same amount of space). The key to this is reusing space from computations in the recursive solution. Here are the details for TM <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> that decides <span class="math inline">\(L^{*}\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mark the first unprocessed position on the tape (initially the very first tape). If that is marking a space, meaning we have nothing left to process (the remaining input is <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> accepts.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> loops over the remaining cells in the tape. If the first unprocessed position is at position <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> then we do the following for positions <span class="math inline">\(k=j+1,\cdots,n\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Mark position <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> as the first unprocessed cell, and then simulate <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> on input cells <span class="math inline">\(j,...,k-1\)</span> to test if that substring is in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. If it’s not, we skip the rest of this iteration and check the next <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> value.</p></li>
<li><p>If the substring is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we recursively run <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> on input <span class="math inline">\(k,...,n\)</span>. We no longer need the space used by step a above, so we reuse that space in our recursive invocation of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>If we complete all iterations from our initial <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (i.e., not a recursive call) without accepting, then we reject.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> accepts an input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, it is because it has divided the input into substrings each of which is in <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (and accepted in step 2a), so <span class="math inline">\(w\in L^{*}\)</span>. If it doesn’t accept, then it falls through to step 3 and rejects. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> accepts <span class="math inline">\(L^{*}\)</span>. Step 2a is the only step that explicitly uses any space, and will take at most <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span> space on any invocation. Since that space is reused, the total space used is <span class="math inline">\(O(n^k)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
