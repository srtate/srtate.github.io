<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 4.2) [<em>How to “grade” your work (10 points): The problem states that “a brief description” is fine, and so the answer doesn’t need to be complex or overly formal. You do need a formal (set notation) definition of the language (3 points - the input must be correct with the pair of <span class="math inline">\(M,R\)</span> for 2 points, then 1 point for the rest). Then you need to describe converting the regular expression to NFA and then NFA to DFA and then using <span class="math inline">\(EQ_{DFA}\)</span> (2 points each part, and 1 point for overall clarity and completeness of the explanation). </em>]</p>
<p>The language definition for this problem is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
EQ_{\text{DFAREG}} = \{ \langle M, R\rangle\,|\,
M \text{ is a DFA}, R\text{ is a regular expression, and }
L(M)=L(R)
\}
\]</span></p>
<p>To decide <span class="math inline">\(EQ_{\text{DFAREG}}\)</span> for input <span class="math inline">\(\langle M,R\rangle\)</span>, we first convert <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to an NFA <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (using the procedure given in the proof of Lemma 1.55 in the textbook), and then convert <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> into a DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> (using the procedure given in the proof of Theorem 1.39 in the textbook). Now we have an DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(L(D)=L(R)\)</span>, and we can test if <span class="math inline">\(\langle M,D\rangle\in EQ_{\text{DFA}}\)</span> using the decision procedure for <span class="math inline">\(EQ_{\text{DFA}}\)</span> (from Theorem 4.5 in the textbook) to decide whether <span class="math inline">\(L(M)=L(D)=L(R)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>[<em>How to “grade” your work (10 points): This is very similar to the proof of Theorem 4.5 in the book, so correct solutions will probably look a lot like this. The basic idea is worth 7 points, and if you leave off the explicit TM description (<span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> below) just take off 3 points as long as there is a decent description of the idea. </em>]</p>
<p>When considering whether <span class="math inline">\(A\subseteq B\)</span>, the subset condition is violated if and only there is some element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that is in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> but not in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(A\subseteq B\)</span> if and only if the set <span class="math inline">\(A\cap\overline{B}\)</span> is empty. In the context of this question, it means that <span class="math inline">\(\langle M_1,M_2\rangle\in {SUBSET}_{DFA}\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(L(M_1)\cap\overline{L(M_2)}\)</span> is empty. The proof then uses the same ideas as the proof of Theorem 4.5 in the textbook.</p>
<p>Given DFAs <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, we first construct a DFA <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> that accepts <span class="math inline">\(\overline{L(M_2)}\)</span> by changing all accepting states into non-accepting states, and vice-versa. Then we use the intersection construction from Chapter 1 to create a DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> that accepts <span class="math inline">\(L(M_1)\cap L(T)=L(M_1)\cap\overline{L(M_2)}\)</span>, and we can decide whether <span class="math inline">\(L(D)\)</span> is empty using the TM from Theorem 4.4 for <span class="math inline">\(E_{TM}\)</span>. The actual TM that decides <span class="math inline">\({SUBSET}_{DFA}\)</span> is the same as in Theorem 4.5, but using DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. To spell it out entirely, it is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F=\)</span> ``On input <span class="math inline">\(\langle M_1,M_2\rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> are DFAs:</p>
<p>    <strong>1.</strong> Construct DFA <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> as described above.</p>
<p>    <strong>2.</strong> Run TM <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> from Theorem 4.4 on input <span class="math inline">\(\langle D\rangle\)</span>.</p>
<p>    <strong>3.</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> accepts, <em>accept</em>; if <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> rejects, <em>reject.</em>"</p></li>
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 5.12) [<em>How to “grade” your work (12 points): This is very similar to the solution of Exercise 5.11, given in the textbook. Since students were referred to 5.10 and 5.11 solutions, it’s likely that most solutions will look like this. Important parts include the formal definition that takes a TM as input (3 points), setup of a proof by contradiction (1 point for setup) that includes the the creation of a machine (<span class="math inline">\(T_w\)</span> below) that ignores its input but works on a hardcoded <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> instead (4 points) that writes a blank if and only if input to <span class="math inline">\(A_{TM}\)</span> accepts (2 points), and then uses the WBL solution (2 points). </em>]</p>
<p>The problem here is to show that the following language is undecidable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \textit{WBL} = \{ \langle M\rangle\,|\, M
  \text{ is a TM that writes a blank over a nonblank for some input}\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Assume for the sake of contradiction that <span class="math inline">\(\textit{WBL}\)</span> is decidable, so there is some TM <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that decides it. We create a TM to decide <span class="math inline">\(A_{TM}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S=\)</span> ``On input <span class="math inline">\(\langle M,w \rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a TM:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create TM <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> writes a “fake-blank” symbol any time <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> would write a blank. The input to the transition function treats the fake-blank the same as a real blank, but this ensures <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> never writes a blank over a nonblank.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to construct the following TM <span class="math inline">\(T_w\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_w=\)</span> "On any input:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Simulate <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the simulation shows that <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> accepts, then write a blank symbol over a nonblank on the tape."</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Run <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\langle T_w\rangle\)</span> to determine whether <span class="math inline">\(T_w\)</span> ever writes a blank symbol over a nonblank.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> accepts, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> accepts <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, so <em>accept</em>. Otherwise, <em>reject</em>."</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that <span class="math inline">\(T_w\)</span> writes a blank over a nonblank if and only if <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is accepted by <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, so if <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> correctly decides when a TM writes a blank over a nonblank then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> decides <span class="math inline">\(A_{TM}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(A_{TM}\)</span> is undecidable, this is impossible, and this contradiction completes the proof the <span class="math inline">\(\textit{WBL}\)</span> is undecidable.</p></li>
<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 5.15) [<em>How to “grade” your work (12 points): The formal definition is worth 3 points: it must take inputs <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and if this isn’t right it’s unlikely anything else can be. Beyond that, the key here is not just the simulation (although that’s important), but the ability to detect infinite loops. Only moving right, with only blanks on the tape after the input, is what allows us to detect infinite loops which are otherwise impossible to detect (i.e., the halting problem). A good solution needs to define a TM, like <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> below (3 points for a formal TM definition) and it must be able to explicitly detect infinite loops in the underlying machine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (6 points). </em>]</p>
<p>We first formulate the problem as a language:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ ML = \{\langle M,w\rangle\,|\,M \text{ is a TM and at some point
  when processing $w$, $M$ attempts to move left}\} \]</span></p>
<p>To show that <span class="math inline">\(ML\)</span> is decidable, we give an algorithm (i.e., a TM) for deciding the language. The idea here is that any TM that never moves left will move right every step and will reach the end of a length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> input in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> steps (if it doesn’t halt first). At that point, if it only moves right it will only see blanks on the tape, so it will either halt or eventually repeat a state (since there only finitely many states). If it repeats a state it will go into an infinite loop and repeat prior actions, so if it hasn’t moved left before that point then it will never move left.</p>
<p>To make it easier to keep track of what states have been visited after hitting the right end of the input, we’ll use a 2-tape Turing machine. This could be simulated with a standard one-tape TM by Theorem 3.13 in the textbook.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S=\)</span> "On input <span class="math inline">\(\langle M,w \rangle\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a TM:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> simulates <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> on input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and if it ever tries to move left (i.e., use a transition with a “L” move), then we accept. If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> halts without attempting to move left, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> rejects. If we reach a blank tape symbol, we have passed by all input, so we move on to step 2.</p></li>
<li><p>We continue to simulate <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, using tape 2 to mark off every state from TM <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that is visited while reading a blank symbol; <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> accepts if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> ever attempts to move left and rejects if <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> halts. For example, if TM <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is in state 7 when reading a blank, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will move the the 7th cell on its second tape – if the cell is blank, we put a <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{x}\)</span> in the cell, and if it was already <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{x}\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> immediately rejects (<span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> has entered an infinite loop without ever attempting to move left)."</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The key to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>’s functioning is step 2: <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> must eventually attempt to move left or go into an infinite loop by transitioning to a previously-used state. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> will always halt with the correct accept/reject decision, so <span class="math inline">\(ML\)</span> is decidable.</p></li>
</ol>
