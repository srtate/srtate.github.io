This solution is also much easier to turn into a fully-specified TM state diagram. For grading: Trace the following strings through the steps to make sure it works correctly on each (1 points each): <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>, 001, 100, 010 should all be accepted. 0, 01, 110, and 0001 should not.</em></p>
<p><em>The other solution makes separate passes for each symbol – one pass to cross off a 1, then rewind; a pass to cross off a 0, then rewind; and another pass to cross off a 0, then rewind (the passes can be done in any order). While this works, and is reasonably straightforward to state at the implementation level, when turning it into a state diagram for the next question the “rewind” part is tricky — there’s no way for a TM to detect the left end of the tape, so you need to mark the first tape symbol.</em>]</p>

<li><p>(Textbook, Exercise 3.11) [<em>How to “grade” your work (10 points): There are multiple, quite different, solutions to this problem. Study the solution below first and make sure you understand it, but then you can consider alternatives. For example, instead of shifting the tape to the right as needed, you can use a second tape to store symbols “to the left” of the starting position, with the state encoding whether you are on the left part of the tape or the right. You can then refer back to the textbook’s result that a two-tape TM has the same computational power as a single-tape TM. You do need a few details (for example, transitions on the “left side” of the tape switch directions, so a transition that would move left now moves right on the second tape). You also need to handle when you transition from the left part of the tape to the right part (or vice-versa). You will need to recognize the origin of the tape, so you’ll still need the same marking trick as in the solution below. There are probably other creative solutions, but these are the main two. For a 10 point grading, the right overall structure and idea is worth 7 points. Details (such as marking the left end of the tape, etc.) are worth 1 point each. </em>]</p>
<p>Given a Turing Machine <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with a doubly-infinite tape, we create a simulator using a standard one-way-infinite tape that shifts the entire tape to the right one position if it ever tries to move left from the leftmost tape cell – this effectively extends the tape as far to the left as needed. There are two slightly subtle issues that have to be addressed for this to work.</p>
<p>First, to shift the tape to the right, you have to be able to tell when you reach the rightmost non-blank tape cell. The first idea is to stop shifting when you see a blank — however, since <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{␣}\)</span> is part of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>’s tape alphabet, <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> could in fact write a <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{␣}\)</span> in the middle of the tape, so this is an unreliable “right end marker.” To correct for this, we add a “written space” symbol that we’ll denote with a tilde: <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span>. Now every transition of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> that would write a space writes <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span> instead, and transitions otherwise treat <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{␣}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span> the same. Since <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> no will never write a <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{␣}\)</span>, the blank is now a valid end-of-tape marker.</p>
<p>Second, <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> needs to be able to recognize the left end of the tape. To do this, we make marked versions of all input symbols (including the new <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span> symbol). Then we start our simulation by marking the leftmost symbol: so if the first symbol on the tape is <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{x}\)</span> then we overwrite it with <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\texttt{x}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With these two ideas, we two ideas we can describe the simulator <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S=\)</span> "On input <span class="math inline">\(w\in\Sigma^*\)</span>:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Overwrite the current symbol with its “dotted version” and return to the first position on the tape.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Perform the same moves as <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, except:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> would write a blank, instead write <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> would move left and the current symbol is a dotted version (meaning you’re at the left end of the tape), write a dotted <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{~}\)</span> in the leftmost position and shift all tape symbols to the right one position (writing only non-dotted symbols) until you reach a <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{␣}\)</span>. Then rewind to the dotted symbol and move to the right one position (to the old first symbol). Now you can do the “move left” transition.</p></li>
<li><p>If neither of the previous conditions are met, then just do the transition from <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, overwriting a dotted symbols with a dotted symbol, and non-dotted symbols with non-dotted symbols.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Simulator <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> performs the same sequence of state transitions (simulated) as <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, making additional space on the left as needed. This accurately simulates a TM with a doubly-infinite tape, so the languages recognized by TMs with doubly-infinite tapes is just the class of Turing-recognizable languages.</p></li>
