        <h2 id="npc-proofs">NPC proofs</h2>
<p>This write-up is an attempt to help guide you in creating NP completeness proofs <em>after you learn the basics</em>. You should read Chapter 7 in the textbook <em>first</em>, which introduces the ideas from the ground up, and then you can go through this. The organization here is different: I start with what you want to do (write a proof that some language is NP complete) and work backwards to uncover the pieces that have to be in the proof. Since I’m working from the end backwards, it’s a terrible way to try to initialy learn the concepts. However, once you understand the basics, this is a good way of thinking about how to <em>apply</em> those concepts.</p>
<p>I’ll first guide you through the structure of an NP-completeness proof alongside a complete NP-completeness proof, so you can see the general idea and motivation for the structure, and then a concrete realization of that in a proof. The concrete proof is a proof that a language called <span class="math inline">\(\textit{PARTITION}\)</span> is NP-complete.</p>
<p>On the next page, you will find the definition of the <span class="math inline">\(\textit{PARTITION}\)</span> problem and the full NP-completeness proof. Read the definition carefully so you understand the problem, and then read through the proof. You don’t have to understand everything in the proof at this point – we’ll walk through it piece by piece after that.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief “table of contents” of these pages:</p>

<li><p><a href="npc2.html">Full NP-completeness proof</a> for <span class="math inline">\(\textit{PARTITION}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><a href="npc3.html">Part-by-part examination</a> of the required parts of an NP-completeness proof, indentifying specifically where they are in the example proof.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="npc4.html">Grading criteria</a> for an NP-completeness proof. Basically, now to “grade” your own proof and make sure all the requirements are met.</p></li>
