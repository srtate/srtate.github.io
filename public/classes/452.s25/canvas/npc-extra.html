<p>How do we select the known NP-complete problem? First, you need to identify what are allowable “known NP-complete problems” – in a real-world setting, this could be any problem that has been proved to be NP-complete by any reputable source. Anything! However, if you’re reading this then you’re most likely a student in a class, and you’ll have to write a proof for an assignment or on an exam. In that case, your instructor should give you guidance on what problems can be used. There are almost certainly a collection of problems that have been proved to be NP-complete in your textbook, with common examples being SAT, 3SAT, CLIQUE, VERTEX-COVER, HAMILTONIAN-PATH, and SUBSET-SUM. If they were established as being NP-complete in your textbook, then they are almost certainly fair game for you to use in your proof. Beyond that it gets a little more uncertain. If in doubt, ask your instructor!</p>
<p>Beyond knowing the set of known NP-complete problems that you can use, how do you find the <em>right</em> one? We’ll talk about this more in general later, but for now we notice that <span class="math inline">\(\textit{SUBSET-SUM}\)</span> shares some features (like adding up elements from theinput) as our <span class="math inline">\(\textit{PARTITION}\)</span> problem, and it turns out that works just fine.</p>
