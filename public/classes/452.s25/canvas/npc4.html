<p>On this page I’ll go through how I would grade a student-submitted NP-completeness proof. Let’s say it’s a 15 point problem, and so I’ll allocate points based on the basic proof components that we’ve discussed. Here’s a breakdown – go back through the example proof and see if you can identify the specific parts of the proof that correspond to these items:</p>
<p><strong>1 Point:</strong> Are the parts of the proof easily identified or introduced (typically individual paragraphs), and is the proof properly concluded?</p>
<p><strong>4 Points:</strong> Proof that the language is in NP. Of these 4 points, let’s break it down like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>2 points:</em> Does the proof clearly state/define what the certificate is? Does it explain (or is it clear) that such a certificate exists if and only if the input is in the language?</p></li>
<li><p><em>2 points:</em> Does the proof clearly state what the verifier does, and why it’s polynomial time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4 points:</strong> Definition/description of the reduction function. This part needs to identify a known NP-complete problem, and give a procedure for converting an input designed for that language into an input designed for the language we’re proving is NP-complete.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Overarching issue:</em> Is the reduction done in the correct direction? It must covert an input for the known NP-complete problem into an input for the problem we’re interested in. If the proof starts with an input for <em>our</em> problem, then it’s backwards and pretty much nothing in the rest of the proof is useful.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2 points:</em> Is the reduction function clearly defined? It cannot make any assumptions about the input at all (that it is or is not in the language, for instance).</p></li>
<li><p><em>2 points:</em> Is it justified (or clear and just stated) that the reduction can be computed in polynomial time?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3 points:</strong> The “if” direction of the NP-completeness proof. In other words, if <span class="math inline">\(KNPC\)</span> is the known NP-complete problem we’re using, and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the language we’re trying to prove, this is the part of the proof that shows that “if <span class="math inline">\(x\in KNPC\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\in L\)</span>”.</p>
<p><strong>3 points:</strong> The “only if” direction of the NP-completeness proof. In other words, this is the part of the proof that shows that “if <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\in L\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(x\in KNPC\)</span>”.</p>
<p>Try taking one of your proofs and going through these points, and grade your work. Did you get everything? Does this identify areas you need to improve?</p>
<p>Next we’ll look at some examples of common errors students make in NP-completeness proofs: <a href="npc5.html">next</a></p>
