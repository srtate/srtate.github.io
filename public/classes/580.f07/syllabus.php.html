  and related concepts;  <LI>describe how basic cryptographic building blocks are combined to
  meet high-level security goals in protocols like SSL and IPsec;  <LI>identify specific security technologies that can improve aspects
  of a system design;  <LI>design sound network architectures by applying security
  technologies such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
  virus scanners;  <LI>justify the use of particular technologies, settings, and
  parameters to meet specified security goals;  <LI>evaluate the security of systems that use cryptography and secure
  communication techniques;  <LI>discuss how privacy issues can impact system design;  <LI>(Graduate students) explain and critique current basic research

<P><P><B>Other Reading:</B>  
<UL><LI>Graduate students will be given copies of current research
  papers to read and critique -- these 
  will also be available on the class web page when possible.
<LI>Optional supplemental information:  There are many other excellent
sources of information on cryptography and computer security.  Please
see the class web page for an up-to-date list of good material and
links to online information.
</UL>
<P><P><B>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</B> The primary
method of instruction will be three 50-minute periods per week for
lecture and discussion, with students responsible for completing
assigned readings, assignments, and preparing for exams outside of
class.  Assignments will be a mix of written analysis and applied
programming or system experimentation.  Written assignments should be
turned in on paper and may be either neatly handwritten or printed.
Please do not e-mail written homework solutions unless it is an
emergency situation, and in that case please use a system-independent
format such as a text file or a PDF -- <EM>do not e-mail Word
files</EM>.  Programs may be written in any language that can satisfy the
assignment requirements and that I can run, including C, C++, and Java
(check with me in advance if you want to use another language), and
you should turn in a printout of your source code.  In some cases
programming assignments should also be submitted electronically, in
which case instructions will be given with the assignment.
<P><I>Graduate Students:</I> In addition to the work described above,
graduate students will be given three research papers to read during
the semester.  After reading each paper, students are expected to
write a 1-2 page summary and critique of the assigned reading.  In
addition, graduate students will complete a project based on current
research in a security-related topic of their own chosing, with the
result typically being a 10-15 page survey paper summarizing research
related to that topic.
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each assignment will be labeled with the
number of points that it will count, relative to other assignments.
Scores will be combined to produce a final average according to the
following weighting scheme:

<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B>   Students are expected to be familiar
with and abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online
at 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>
<P>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise.  General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assignments should not be discussed and any submitted work should be
entirely your own.  It is expected that the class textbook will be
used as a reference, but if any other reference materials are used in
preparing homework solutions they should be clearly cited.  Any
incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in
either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the
severity of the incident, and incidents will be reported to the
appropriate UNCG office.
<P>Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do (assignments and exams).  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."
<P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for
everything done or said in class (this can include changes in
assignments, due dates, etc.).  It is the student's responsibility to
obtain notes from another student if they miss class.
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Laptops can be both a benefit and a distraction in a classroom.  While
many students benefit from taking notes using a laptop, or having
access to outside class-related resources during class, other students
cannot resist the temptation of checking e-mail, chatting, or even
playing games during class time.  This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, and may
be turned in up to 7 calendars days late with a 25% late penalty.
<EM>No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after
  the original due date!</EM>
<P>Exam/test dates will be announced at least two weeks in advance, and
may be made up <EM>only</EM> if it was missed due to an extreme
emergency and arrangements are made <EM>before</EM> the exam date.
Exams (including the final) may not be taken early or late due to
personal travel plans.
<P><B>Final Exam:</B>  Friday, December 14, 12:00 - 3:00.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B>  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a diability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
