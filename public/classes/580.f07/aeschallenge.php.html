    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>AES Challenge - Extra Credit - Due: Friday, October 12</H1>
    
    
    <P><P>This handout describes the extra-credit challenge assignment that
involves implementing AES.  What you need to do to complete this
assignment is to implement AES encryption with a 128-bit key.  The
following amounts of extra credit are available, as points added to
your total cumulative assignment points:

</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
Email me your solution before midnight on October 12 in order to be
considered.  I will first test all submissions by running test vectors
through in order to see that they give the correct answers.  Then I
will look at the code of the working submissions to see which I think
is the most cleanly or elegantly implemented (and comments count
too!).  Finally, I'll run a "speed test" of all working
implementations, where I encrypt around 100,000 blocks of plaintext
with each implementation.  The implementation that runs fastest gets
those extra credit points.
<P>In order to be able to test these, it is important that everyone use
the same interface.  To implement this, write a class called
<CODE>AESCipher</CODE> that has two methods (at least - if you want to add
more, feel free, as long as they make sense).  The first method will
set the key for the block cipher (call this <CODE>setKey</CODE>), and the
second will encrypt a block of plaintext (call this <CODE>encrypt</CODE>).
You can call <CODE>encrypt</CODE> multiple times without having to call
<CODE>setKey</CODE> again, so if you can do any pre-computations with the
key in <CODE>setKey</CODE> then the subsequent encryptions will run faster
(hint, hint...).
<P>There is sample code on the following page showing how these methods
should be defined.  The actual methods will be replaced, of course,
but the method signatures (parameters, etc.) in your code should be
<EM>exactly</EM> as shown in the example.  You can <a href="aestemplate.cpp">download this code</a>
from the class web page, so that you can replace the method bodies
while leaving the interfaces the same.
<P>The class web page will have a few "<a href="aestest.php.html">test vectors</a>" that you can use
to see if your code works properly.  Make sure you use these to make
sure you did things right!
