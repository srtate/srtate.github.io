<li><p><i>Assignment 10 (100 points): Due Friday, Dec. 7</i></p><p>
There are many interesting network security technologies and tools, so
obviously the textbook doesn't cover them all.  From the list below,
pick one of the two technologies and one of the two tools, do some
Internet searching to find out about your topic, and write a one page
summary of each.  For technologies, make sure you describe the purpose
of the technology (what it does or what problem it is addressing), how
it works, and what software or tools are available that implement this
technology.  For tools, describe the purpose of the tool, what it
does, how to operate it, and if there are other tools that do similar
things.  Obviously a one-page summary isn't going to be terribly
extensive, so do your best to select the most important and
significant aspects of the technologies/tools to highlight.  Use more
than one source for your information - Wikipedia is good, but it's not
<i>that</i> good.  Also, make sure you write your own description -
don't copy it from somewhere else.  Also keep in mind that writing
quality matters: don't just list off characteristics - write it so
that it reads well for someone who is technically competent but not an
expert in the area.

<dt><i>Technologies:</i></dt>
<dd><ol><li>Port Knocking</li><li>Honeypots (or honeynets)</li></ol></dd>
<dt><i>Tools:</i></dt>
<dd><ol><li>dsniff (I'm talking about the package of tools that dsniff is a part of, not just the dsniff program itself)</li><li>Nessus</li></ol></dd>
</dl>
<p>
You only have to do two summaries for this assignment, but you can get up to 25 extra points for each additional one that you do (so it's possible to get a 150 on this assignment!).

<h3>Graduate Student Readings and Project</h3>

<p>Shown below are assigned graduate student readings, along with due dates and links to papers.  Reports should be written according to the <a href="readings.php.html">distributed guidelines</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li> <i>Reading 1:  Report Due Wednesday, October 17</i>
<blockquote>
<p>J. Mason, K. Watkins, J. Eisner, and A. Stubblefield.  "<a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1180405.1180435">A Natural
Language Approach to Automated Cryptanalysis of Two-time Pads</a>,"
<i>Proceedings of the 13th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS)</i>, 2006, pp. 235-244.</p>
<p><i>A note on this link:</i> The link above goes to the ACM "Digital Library" for the published version of the paper.  This is a subscription service, but UNCG has a subscription so the link should work from any UNCG on-campus system (just follow the "PDF" link from the ACM page to get the actual paper).  From off-campus, you can go through the UNCG library.  Alternatively, you can get the paper directly from one of the author's web pages <a href="http://spar.isi.jhu.edu/josh/">here</a>.
