<center><h2>Homework 3 - Blown to Bits Wrap-up<br/>Due Wednesday, Nov. 28</h2></center>

<p>You have read, and we have
discussed, six chapters from the book <i>Blown to
Bits</i>. For this homework assignment I would like you to think
back over those six chapters, and write a couple of pages on what
those readings have taught you, and where you think we'll be in ten
years on these issues. The guiding principle on length and depth
should be whether you can say something convincing with appropriate
justification, but for those of you who like more nitty-gritty
guidelines I would suggest that you shoot for two pages with one inch
margins all around, in 11 point Times New Roman font and line spacing
set at 1.5 lines.</p>
<p>When I say "on
these issues" in regards to the <i>Blown to Bits</i>
book, I'm not talking about the technology, but rather about society
and governmental issues that arise from the technology. You should
pick two specific issues from the topics discussed in the first six
chapters of the book - pick and choose the ones that you feel you can
address the most clearly. Your writing should include clear
justifications and evidence for your statements - it should not be
just idle speculation and guessing. The following is a list of some
things to think about that you could incorporate into your
essay. Hopefully some of these ideas will strike a particular chord
with you as an issue that you care about and can write
about.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there areas of our lives that are still in the process of
being changed by the digitization of everything? Technology makes it
easier to both track what people are doing (remember the cell phone
towers and location tracking) and to hide from monitoring (remember
encryption) - is one of these directions advancing faster than the
other? Could you name some specific high-impact technologies that were
discussed in the book that suggest what things will look like in ten
years?</li>
<li>How do you think digital privacy and tracking issues will change
over the next ten years? Technology obvious exists to track us in lots
of ways, from cell phones to financial transactions to RFID tags in
clothing - does the government have a role in regulating this? Are
people aware of the issues, and is public awareness a factor in
adoption or use of these technologies?</li>
<li>When it
comes to digital data formats, what else might be "hidden" inside
files in a non-obvious way? Documents or pictures contain a lot of
metadata, and files exist beyond when you think they might. Should or
will technology be developed to better remove information at
appropriate times (e.g., truly deleting information when files are
deleted), or do people simply not care enough for this to be an
issue?</li>
<li>Does our increasing reliance on search engines to find information
mean that more regulation of those services is warranted? Will search
engines start becoming used as regulators of what we are allowed to
see (whether restricted by controlling governments, or controlled by
copyright holders' interests)?  Are there influential factors or
entities (commercial or governmental) in searching that should be more
openly revealed?</li>
<li>Will government move to increase control over encryption, or are
the crypto wars truly over? What would happen if there were a major
terrorist attack, and it was discovered that the planning was done
over securely encrypted communication services? Can you draw any
lessons from past reactions of society and government to predict how
this might be responded to in the future? On the other side, do
ordinary people care about privacy enough to use encryption more
often?</li>
<li>How will the balance of power with regard to copyright change in
the future?  Will technology lock down content so thoroughly that laws
are less relevant? Will laws become more draconian and controlling?
Will widespread sharing of content destroy previous business models
that deal with distribution of creative content? Will services on the
Internet be forced to incorporate a massive copyright protection
infrastructure due to either government mandate (e.g., SOPA) or
pressure from copyright holders?</li>
</ul>
<p>For your
essay, I am expecting you to address at least two areas of
technological impact on society. I'm not going to require a specific
outline, but a good structure might be as follows: an introductory
paragraph that stakes out your basic position and what you're going to
address (roughly half a page), followed by a paragraph for each area
you are considering that contains justified statements (about 3/4 of a
page each), followed by a conclusion and summary paragraph that brings
everything back together (again about half a page). Whether you follow
that outline or not, your position for each area should be justified
by concrete facts - you need a minimum of two specific items that show
the direction societal impact is heading, and these two items can be
stories/facts from <i>Blown to Bits</i> or can be
clearly documented stories from news or other reliable
sources.</p>
<p>Finally,
professionalism and a scholarly approach to your writing are
important. Spelling and grammar are important, as are clearly
constructed sentences that logically make your case. As you look over
a draft of your essay, ask yourself the question "Would someone
reading this think that it is coming from an educated and thoughtful
person?" You better be able to answer that with a resounding
"yes"!</p>
