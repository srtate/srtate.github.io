<h1>Blogging</h1>

<p>I think blogging is a good way of helping yourself reflect on
your progress and your learning, and to share with others your
thoughts about the class.  Of course, you could get the same
"reflection" benefits by writing private journal entries, or simply by
having some quiet time to think about things, but sharing in public
forces you put things in terms that others will understand.</p>

<p>There are lots of different systems you can use to publish a blog,
and you can use any one that you like (and I'll link to it).
UNCG's use of Google "Apps for Education" means all UNCG students have
a "Blogger" account associated with their UNCG email.  Here's how you
can set that up: </p>

<ol>
<li>Log in to your iSpartan email account at <a
href="http://mail.uncg.edu/">mail.uncg.edu</a></li>
<li>In the iSpartan menu bar (at the top of the browser window), click
in the "More" link, and select "Blogger" from the menu.</li>
<li>Click on the "New Blog" button, and follow the instructions!</li>
</ol>

<p>
You'll need a name for your blog, and can play around with themes and
different looks.</p.

<p>
Once you've started your blog, email me a link to your blog - I'll add
your link on <a href="http://uncg-csc-100.blogspot.com/">my
class blog</a> page so that there's a single place to look for all
student class blogs.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the semester, we'll have a vote for the "best class
blog," so remember to check back every now and then and see what
others are writing about!
