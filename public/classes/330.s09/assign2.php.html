    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 2 -- Using Maps<BR><FONT SIZE=+2><I>Due:
      Wednesday, September 23</I></FONT></H1>
    
    
    
<P><P><B>Objective:</B> The objective of this assignment is for students
to work with and show they understand how to use associative
containers (course objective 5 from the syllabus).  <I>This
  program is shorter and less involved than others in this class, so
  this assignment will be graded out of 50 points -- half the weight
  of other assignments.</I>
<P><B>High-Level Description:</B>  
In the first assignment you wrote a program to figure out word
frequencies:  how often a word appears in a text file.  In this
assignment you are to consider character frequencies, but also
consider the notion of "context" -- in this case the "context" is
the preceding character, so rather than counting the number of times
the character "<TT>u</TT>" occurs (for example), you will count the
number of times "<TT>u</TT>" follows "<TT>q</TT>", how many times
"<TT>u</TT>" follows "<TT>r</TT>", and so on.
<P><B>Details:</B> You are to write two programs for this assignment,
<TT>count1.cpp</TT> and <TT>count2.cpp</TT>.  Both programs read the
input (from standard input) character-by-character, and update counts
after each character is read.  Use <TT>cin.get()</TT> for character input.
<P>For <TT>count1.cpp</TT> you are simply to keep track of how many times
each character occurs.  This is a basic <TT>map&lt;char,int&gt;</TT> object
that increments the count as each character is seen.  At the end of
the program, print out each character and the number of times it
occurs.
<P>For <TT>count2.cpp</TT> you are to keep a <EM>separate</EM> set of
counts for each context -- in other words, for each character
"context" (meaning the previous character) you will have a complete
set of counts.  This is a map of maps -- and part of this assignment
is to figure out exactly what that means as a C++ <TT>map</TT>
declaration, and to use it in your program.  At the end of the
program, print out each pair of characters and the count of the number
of times that pair occurred.
<P>See the sample input and output
below
and follow the basic form shown there for your program's output.
<P><B>To Turn In:</B> Use the <CODE>330submit</CODE> program (see 
<A HREF="grading.php.html">Handout 3</A>)
in order to turn in your code, using assignment name <CODE>assign2</CODE>.
You should submit all of your code (for both programs) so that it can
be compiled and tested.  On the due date, you should turn in a
printout of your code.
