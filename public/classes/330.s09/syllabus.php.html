<P><P>CLASS WEB SITE:  <A HREF="http://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/srtate/330/"><CODE>http://www.uncg.edu/cmp/faculty/srtate/330/</CODE></A>
<P><P>CATALOG DESCRIPTION:  Static and dynamic data structures emphasizing
binary trees and graphs. Advanced programming techniques. Advanced
sorting and searching algorithms. Hashing techniques. Performance
analysis. Methods of developing large applications programs.
<P><P>STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES:
Upon successful completion of this course students will have
demonstrated that they
<OL><LI>understand inheritance and abstract classes;
<LI>can design divide-and-conquer algorithms using three steps and apply
  to merge sort, quick sort, dynamic programming, and backtracking;
<LI>understand tree representation and traversals;
<LI>understand graph representation and traversals; and
<LI>know associative containers, 2-3-4 trees, and red-black trees.
</OL>
In addition to the above academic outcomes, students will gain
practical experience working with a Unix-style system throughout the course.
<P><P>TEACHING METHODS AND ASSIGNMENTS FOR ACHIEVING LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
Class will meet twice a week for 75 minutes.  Class time will include
brief overviews of the material, but students are expected to have
completed the textbook readings before class so that the majority of class
time can be used for discussing the material, answering questions and
clarifying topics from the book, and working through examples.  If
students do not keep up with readings, the instructor may give
in-class quizzes or small reading-summary assignments as extra
motivation. 
<P><B>Assignments:</B> Assignments will be both written and programming.
Programs must be written in C++, and must compile and work correctly
on <CODE>cmpunix.uncg.edu</CODE> (students will be given login information
and a brief system overview before the first assignment).  The
instructor will <EM>not</EM> make any adjustments to a student's code
when grading, so if any submitted program does not compile the student
will get a zero on the "correctness" portion of the grade (or 50
points off the overall grade), with no exceptions -- more information
on grading criteria will be distributed and discussed before the first
assignment.
Program source code will be turned in electronically, and students are
expected to turn in a printout in class or to the instructor.
<P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the <EM>beginning of class</EM> on the due date, and may
be turned in up to 7 calendars days late with a 25% late penalty.
<EM>No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after
  the original due date!</EM>  If the instructor adds assignments to
ensure that students keep up with reading assignments, these will not
be accepted late for any reason.
<P>Exam/test dates are on the schedule 
below
-- if there are
any changes, they will be announced at least two weeks in advance if
possible.  A
missed exam
may be made up <EM>only</EM> if it was missed due to an extreme
emergency and arrangements are made <EM>before</EM> the exam date.
Exams (including the final) may not be taken early or late due to
personal travel plans.
<P><P>EVALUATION AND GRADING:  Each student activity will contribute to the
final grade in the class according to the following percentages.

<P><P>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY:
Students are required to sign the Academic Integrity Pledge on any
work they do.  The pledge is the statement "I
have abided by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy on this
assignment."  For information on the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy,
see
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>. 
<P>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise.  General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assignments should not be discussed and any submitted work should be
done entirely your own.  The instructor uses a program comparison
system that compares submissions and highlights programs that are too
similar in order to detect cheating.
<P>It is expected that the class textbook will be
used as a reference, but if any other reference materials (including
web sites) are used in
preparing homework solutions they should be clearly cited.  Any
incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in
either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the
severity of the incident, and incidents will be reported to the
appropriate UNCG office.
<P><P>ATTENDANCE POLICY:
Attendance will not be taken in class, and is voluntary; however, all
students are responsible for everything done or said in class (this
can include changes in assignments, due dates, etc.).  It is the
student's responsibility to obtain notes from another student if they
miss class -- the instructor will not provide notes.
<P><P>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
Laptops can be both a benefit and a distraction in a classroom.  While
many students benefit from taking notes using a laptop, or having
access to outside class-related resources during class, other students
cannot resist the temptation of checking e-mail, chatting, or even
playing games during class time.  This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><P>ADA STATEMENT:  UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services located in 215 Elliott University Center:  (336) 334-5440.
<P><P>UNIVERSITY CLOSINGS: If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
cancelled.  In such an event, please check the class web page and
Blackboard site for information about if and how the class will
proceed.
