    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Submission Procedures and Grading Guidelines</H1>
    
    
    <P><B>Submission Procedures:</B> In this class you will be using a program
called "<CODE>330submit</CODE>" to turn in your programs electronically.
This program sends copies to me so that they can be checked and
graded.  <CODE>330submit</CODE> is run from the command line on the
<CODE>cmpunix</CODE> system.
The general form of the command is
"<CODE>330submit programno files</CODE>", where "<CODE>programno</CODE>"
is of the form "<CODE>program1</CODE>", "<CODE>program2</CODE>", and so on,
and "<CODE>files</CODE>" is a list of files which may contain wildcards.
<P>I highly recommend that when you do an assignment, you have a
directory just for that assignment.  When you're finished, clean out
all object files and any extra stuff that's in the directory (this is
really easy if you put a "<CODE>clean</CODE>" target in your
<CODE>Makefile</CODE>), and then run <CODE>330submit</CODE> with the wildcard
"<CODE>*</CODE>" as the file name.  This submits all files in your current
directory, which should include all the files that make up your
program.  For example, to do this for Programming Assignment 2, you would type
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER>
<CODE>330submit program2 *</CODE>
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
One important thing to note is that the case of the assignment name is
significant.  It will <EM>not</EM> work if you use the upper case version
"PROGRAM2".  As another example, if you wanted to explicitly give all
the file names, then the files for programming assignment 2 might be submitted
with the command:
<PRE>
    330submit program2 Makefile ListStack.* BlockStack.*
</PRE>
Note that you should be sure to turn in your <CODE>Makefile</CODE>!
<P>There's also a special assignment name of "<CODE>question</CODE>" that you
can use to submit code to me that you have a question about.  If
you need to ask me a question about a program (and have tried to
contact the grader first!), you can send me a copy of your code by
using
<PRE>
    330submit question *
</PRE>
<P><P><B>Grading Guidelines:</B>
Your programs will be judged on several criteria, which are shown
below, along with the questions that they address.  In addition to the
percentages below, the style guidelines give some "major rules" with
specific point-value penalties for violating -- these will be applied
regardless of whether the total penalty exceeds the amount for
"style" given below.
<DL><DT><B><B>Correctness (50 percent):</B></B><DD>  Does the program compile correctly?
Does the program do what it's supposed to do?
<DT><B><B>Design (20 percent):</B></B><DD> Are operations broken down into
functions and procedures in a reasonable way?  Are ADT's clearly
defined, implementation independent, and sensible? 
<DT><B><B>Style (10 percent):</B></B><DD>  Is the program indented
properly?  Do variables have meaningful names?  
<DT><B><B>Robustness (10 percent):</B></B><DD>  Does the program handle
erroneous or unexpected input gracefully?
<DT><B><B>Documentation (10 percent):</B></B><DD> Do all program files begin
with a comment that identifies the author, the contents, and the
compiler used for that particular file?  Are all the procedures and
functions clearly documented using Doxygen comments?  Are unclear parts
of code documented?
</DL>
<P>Notice that correctness is only half of the grade.  Design and style
are very important: you write an English paper by first laying out how
you want the information presented, then writing a rough draft that
makes all your points, and then polishing the style of that rough
draft.  Writing a program is much the same: first design how things
should be organized, then do a "rough draft" that consists of a
working implementation, and then go back and polish your code, adding
all the required comments and make sure style guidelines are followed.
Unfortunately, many people hand in their "rough draft" programs,
thinking that a working program is all they need.  If you do that in
this class, you probably will not pass.
<P>A program that does not compile will get at most 50% of the possible
points for an assignment.  If you add comments after getting your
program working, then be sure you test it again before submitting it.
It is actually fairly easy to make working code inoperable when adding
comments (by forgetting to close a comment, for example).  Even if
your program is entirely correct except for a small mistake of this
type, you will still get a maximum of 50%.  We will use exactly the
same environment to grade your assignments as you use for testing, so
there is no excuse for a program that doesn't compile.
<P>In addition, most programming assignments are given with some sample
inputs and outputs.  If your program does not work correctly on those
sample inputs, you will get at most 75% of the possible points for an
assignment.  Your programs will also be tested on other inputs, but be
sure, at the very least, that your programs work correctly on the
supplied examples.
