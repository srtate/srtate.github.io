The goal of this question is for you to learn a little about the
most cutting-edge static analysis tools for PHP, and to get a little
more experience with security research. To start, you should read the
following paper (handed out in class, but also available from the link
below):
</p>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Johannes Dahse and Thorsten Holz. &#8220;Simulation of Built-in PHP
Features for Precise Static Code Analysis,&#8221; <em>Proceedings of the
Network and Distributed System Symposium (NDSS)</em>, 2014. Available at
<a href="http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/simulation-built-php-features-precise-static-code-analysis">http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/simulation-built-php-features-precise-static-code-analysis</a></p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you start reading this paper, focus on high-level ideas and don&#8217;t
worry about all the details. You can go back and fill in details
later, once you see the &#8220;big picture.&#8221;</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
After reading the paper, set it aside and write a one paragraph
summary of the paper in your own words. Make sure you use the term
&#8220;taint analysis&#8221; and describe what this term means.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The authors listed several PHP language features that make static
analysis difficult. Pick one such language feature that you found
surprising or interesting, describe it, and explain why it causes
difficulties for static analysis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do you consider this research to be a success? Use the
results as described in the Introduction and more fully in Section IV
to justify your answer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Listings 15 and 16 (on pages 11 and 12) show how an XSS
vulnerability is exploited in the <code>osCommerce</code> software. In
particular, if the exploit URL in Listing 16 is used, then the <code>echo</code>
statement in Listing 15 will output HTML that contains a cross-site
scripting exploit. Work through this code and give the exact HTML
output that is produced in this exploit.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Published research papers contain comparisons and references to
related work that was published prior the paper, so someone reading
the paper has some context for the work, and can find prior papers to
see how the ideas have evolved. A natural question when reading a
paper turns this around to ask &#8220;What related work has been done
<em>after</em> this was published?&#8221; Obviously, the paper can&#8217;t include
references to work that hadn&#8217;t been done before the paper was
published, so people use citation search engines to find papers that
cite this one. Google Scholar, at
<a href="http://scholar.google.com/">http://scholar.google.com</a> is a good
example of this. For this part, go to Google Scholar and type in the
first part of the title of this paper to find it. Next, look for the
&#8220;Cited by ..&#8221; link with this paper, and click on it. This will
provide a list of subsequent papers that have cited this paper as
related prior work. For this paper in particular, compare the papers
that come up in this search with the description of &#8220;Future work&#8221; in
the final paragraph of the paper. Find a paper that reports on a
future work item&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;give a reference to this paper, with a brief
description of the problem that it addresses. <br />

For this question, read the short essay:
</p>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Shriram Krighnamurthi and Jan Vitek. &#8220;The Real Software Crisis:
Repeatability as a Core Value,&#8221; <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, March
2015, pp. 34&#8212;36. Available at
<a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/3/183593-the-real-software-crisis/fulltext">http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/3/183593-the-real-software-crisis/fulltext</a></p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Think about how this relates to Section IV.F. of the paper from the
first question, where the authors try to compare their system to
previous systems, but had to make somewhat indirect comparisons since
the code for previous systems wasn&#8217;t available to make head-to-head
comparisons. The essay gives several reasons why software
(&#8220;artifacts&#8221;) might not be published, and there are also clear
benefits to making the code public. What is your opinion? Take a
position either for or against requiring publishing research software
(no being wishy-washy!), and write a short argument for your
position. Justify your position in the context of the essay, making
sure you address arguments both for and against publishing that are
outlined in that essay.</p></div>

Consider the following PHP code for checking a user&#8217;s login
credentials (username and password). Assume that nothing has been done
elsewhere in the code to sanitize user inputs.

Describe this vulnerability in the same style used on your midterm
exam. Specifically, give the following four pieces of information: (a)
a description of the <em><span class="underline">vulnerability</span></em>, (b) a brief
description of how an attacker could <em><span class="underline">exploit</span></em> the
vulnerability, (c) what the <em><span class="underline">consequences</span></em> of the attack
are (revealing secrets, taking over the machine, etc.), and (d) at
least one way to <em><span class="underline">correct the problem</span></em>. For each answer,
clearly label the parts of
your answer using the emphasized words above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For this part, describe an exploit in detail. In other words, give
a specific input that an attacker could use to log in as user
&#8220;admin&#8221;, even without knowing the password.  Also give the resulting
<code>$query</code> string for your input.
