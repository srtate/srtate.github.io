<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> <em>Required</em>: CSC 330. <em>Recommended</em>: CSC 339 or other experience
with C, C++, or another language that supports raw pointers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Course Description:</strong> This course will cover common vulnerabilities in
software, and how software bugs can have serious security
consequences. We will consider buffer overflows, return-oriented
programming, stack smashing, integer overflow, SQL injection,
cross-site scripting, and other classes of vulnerabilities. We will
also look at techniques for avoiding these vulnerabilities, ranging
from good programming practices to the use of static analysis and
other tools. The course will be experimental, with students locating,
exploiting, and fixing vulnerabilities throughout the semester.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes:</strong> Upon successful completion of this course
students will be able to</p></div>

</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Textbook and Readings:</strong> There is no textbook for this course. The
course will be organized around readings that are freely available on
the Internet, taken largely (but not exclusively!) from the following sources:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/">MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) documentation</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/">The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) documentation</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://capec.mitre.org/">MITRE Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://www.securecoding.cert.org/">CERT secure coding standards</a>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition, students will read several research papers to gain
familiarity with current research standards and trends in software
security. Graduate students will read additional and more advanced
research papers. Readings will be posted and updated regularly in the
&#8220;<a href="readings.html">Readings</a>&#8221; section of the class web site.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Technology and Programming Languages:</strong> We will look at a <em>lot</em> of
code in this class. Activities will involve working with Linux systems
and with a wide variety of programming languages, including assembly
language, C, C++, JavaScript, PHP, and more. Students are not
expected to know all of these languages currently, but should be
proficient programmers with good knowledge of assembly language,
C++, and Java. None of the other languages that we will use are
based on radically different concepts, and as upper-level computer
science students you should be able follow examples in these languages
and pick up enough of the basics to do the exercises required for the
class.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This class will make heavy use of a Linux environment and Linux tools.
No prior experience with Linux is necessary, but students
without prior experience are expected to learn the necessary skills
on their own.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Class-Selected &#8220;Target Programs&#8221;:</strong> In order to gain experience
auditing software for security vulnerabilities, the class will select
(through an in-class discussion the first week of the semester) 2-5
open source software projects that will be used throughout the
semester. As we discuss different types of vulnerabilities, students
will be assigned the task of checking for each of these types of
vulnerabilities in the target software.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Ethics and Responsible Disclosure:</strong> Students should not, under any
circumstance, test for vulnerabilities in deployed systems that they
do not have permission to test in such a manner. The lab facilities
available to students are more than adequate for setting up test
systems and allowing for experimentation.  Any vulnerabilities
discovered in software systems should be reported using standards of
responsible disclosure. This will be discussed in class, and if there
are any questions about experimentation or disclosure you should speak
with the instructor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</strong> This class will meet for two
75-minute periods per week, and class meetings will consist of a
combination of lecture/presentation, discussion, and in-class
exercises. Students must to come to class prepared, having done all
required readings, and are expected to participate in in-class
activities. Grades are based on student work done in assignments and
exams.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>In-Class Exercises:</em> Some class days will include in-class activities
that can involve working through problems or completing tasks on a
worksheet. Students must complete these activities during the class
period in which they are distributed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Assignments:</em> There will be approximately four homework assignments
during the semester. Assignments may include problems that involve
analyzing existing code for security vulnerabilities (either manually
or using analysis tools), writing code to explore the consequences of
vulnerabilities, and patching software to remove
vulnerabilities. Homeworks may also include written questions that
involve discussion or analysis in a more general setting (not
code-based).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Exams:</em> There will be one mid-term exam on Thursday, March 5, during
the regular class period. The final exam will be held according to the
official UNCG Final Exam Schedule, which lists the time for this exam
as Thursday, April 30, 3:30-6:30. The format of the final exam for
this class might be unconventional: more information will be provided
at least two weeks before the end of classes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Graduate Students:</em> In addition to the work described above, graduate
students will be given approximately four research papers during the
semester to read and report on with a 1-2 page written summary and
critique. In addition, graduate students will complete a project based
on current research in a software security topic of their own choosing,
with the result typically being a 10-15 page survey paper summarizing
research related to that topic.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Evaluation and Grading:</strong> Each student work product will be graded, and
the student&#8217;s final grade will be determined by assigning each category
of work a weighted score according to the following distribution:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Topic Outline and Calendar:</strong> Since this class has not been offered
before, the timing and precise list of topics may change during the
semester. For the current and planned list of topics and dates, please
see the &#8220;<a href="sched.html">Schedule</a>&#8221; area of the class web site.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> Students are expected to be familiar with and
abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online at
<a href="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/">http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise. General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assigned problems should not be discussed and all submitted work
should be entirely your own.  If you use external references
(including web sites, books, etc.) in preparing your solutions, you
should clearly mark the part(s) of your solution influenced by these
references and provide clear citations to the source of information
you are using. Sharing your own work is a serious violation of academic
integrity, and if homework is copied then <em>both</em> the person who
actually did the work and the person who copied it will be punished.
Any incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly,
resulting in either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class,
depending on the severity of the incident, and incidents will be
reported to the appropriate UNCG office.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Attendance Policy:</strong> Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for everything done
or said in class (this can include changes in assignments, due dates,
etc.). Note that this is a very dynamic class, based on a collection
of readings rather than a structured textbook, so it is highly
unlikely that a student who regularly misses classes will be
successful in the course. The university allows for a limited number
of excused absences for religious observances&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;students who plan to
take such an absence should notify the instructor at least two weeks
in advance so that accommodations can be made (see the late work
policy below). It is the student&#8217;s responsibility to obtain notes from
another student if they miss class.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</strong> Assignments are due at the beginning
of class on the due date, and may be turned in up to 7 calendar days
late with a 25% late penalty. Students with planned absences, whether
for university events, religious observance, or other reason, are
expected to make arrangements with the instructor to turn in
assignments or take exams before the scheduled date of the assignment
or test. No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days
after the original due date!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Exam/test dates will be announced at least two weeks in advance, and
may be made up only if it was missed due to an extreme emergency and
arrangements are made before the exam date. Exams (including the
final) may not be taken early or late due to personal travel plans.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>In-class Behavior:</strong> When you are in class you should be focused on
the class, and you should act in a professional and mature
manner. During class there should be no eating, drinking,
e-cigarettes, cellphone use, non-class related laptop, or anything
else that does not pertain to the class activities. Any distracting
items may be confiscated at the discretion of the instructor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>ADA Statement:</strong> UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA). Students requesting accommodations based on a
disability must be registered with the Office of Accessibility Resources
and Services located in 215 Elliott University Center: (336) 334-5440
(or <a href="http://ods.uncg.edu"><code>http://ods.uncg.edu</code></a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>University Closings:</strong> If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Blackboard site for information about if and how the class will proceed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Commercial note-taking services:</strong> Selling class notes for commercial
gain or purchasing such class notes in this or any other course at UNCG
is a violation of the University&#8217;s Copyright Policy and of the Student
Code of Conduct. Sharing notes for studying purposes, or borrowing notes
to make up for absences, without commercial gain, are not violations.</p></div>
