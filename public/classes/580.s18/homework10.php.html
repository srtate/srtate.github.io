<center><h1>Homework 10 &ndash; Due Tuesday, April 17</h1></center>

<OL><LI>In the last homework, you was that if the "per message secret
  number" in DSA wasn't kept secret, that the signer's private key
  could be computed.  The "per message" part of the phrase "per
  message secret number" is also vital. If an attacker could trick a
  signer into signing two different messages, say <I>M<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>M<sub>2</sub></I>,
  using the same secret <I>k</I>, what can the attacker figure out from
  knowledge of those two signatures and the two messages.
<P>[<I>Hint: As last time, try playing around with the formulas and
    seeing what you can cancel out or otherwise compute. Also, feel
    free to use the results of last week's homework problem in solving
    this one!</I>]
<p>
<LI>What is a certificate and what role does it play in the distribution
of public keys?  Describe what a certificate does, what it protects
against, and how it does this. Be clear on what basic security goal
certificates address (confidentiality, integrity, or availability).
<p>
<LI>What is a certificate revocation list (CRL), and what is it used
  for?  Describe two specific scenarios that would require a CRL.
