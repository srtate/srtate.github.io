<center><h1>Homework 9 &ndash; Due Tuesday, April 10</h1></center>

<OL><LI>There are two main authenticated encryption techniques described in
  the book, CCM and GCM. Describe at least two advantages of GCM over
  CCM.
<p>
<LI>Both MACs and digital signature schemes are designed with the goal of
being resistant to "existential forgery."  Describe what this means
and why this is an important property.
<p>
<LI>The Digital Signature Algorithm (see Figure 13.3 on page 410) starts
by selecting what the book calls the user's "per message secret
number" <I>k</I>, after which <I>r=(g<sup>k</sup> mod p) mod q</I>
becomes part of the signature. Since <I>k</I> is just a random value, not
related to the signer's private key, is it important to protect <I>k</I>?
In particular, what would be the consequences if an attacker could
learn <I>k</I> in addition to the signature <I>(r,s)</I>?
<P>[<I>Hint: See what you can calculate based
on the formulas for <I>r</I> and <I>s</I>, as well as the information that is
known by the attacker. Try taking the
formulas and multiplying through by values, or subtracting formulas
to see what cancels out, or doing other basic algebraic
manipulations to see what you can have "pop out" of the formulas.</I>]
