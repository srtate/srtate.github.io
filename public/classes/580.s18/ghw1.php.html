Graded Homework 1 &ndash; Due Thursday, February 15
</h1></center>


<P><P><P>This homework focuses on exploring research and publishing practices
in computer science and computer security.
<OL><LI>Open (non-commercial) scientific research is fundamentally about
making and sharing discoveries, where the "sharing" part is
accomplished through writing and publishing papers. For any published
work, issues of intellectual property rights and copyright are vital
to understand, and for this question you will examine two policy
documents:
<p>
<UL><LI>UNCG's copyright policy (which is typical of university
  policies): <BR><A HREF="https://policy.uncg.edu/university-policies/copyright/">https://policy.uncg.edu/university-policies/copyright/</A>
<LI>ACM's copyright transfer agreement: <BR><A HREF="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-and-license-forms</A>
</UL>
<p>
Read through these documents, and then answer the following questions
(give thoughtful answers, justifying by referring to or quoting
specific parts of the policy documents as appropriate -- if there are
conditions or assumptions in your answer, make sure you explain those):
<p>
<UL style="list-style:none;"><p>
<LI>(a) Faculty members (who are "EPA employees" in the policy
  document) perform independent scholarship, and publish papers. Who
  owns the copyright to those works? What rights does the university
  have to the work?
<p>
<LI>(b) Staff members (who are "SPA employees" in the policy) may
  create works, such as advertising materials created by staff in
  university relations. Who owns the copyright to those works?  What
  rights does the university have to the work?
<p>
<LI>(c) Students often write papers as part of class requirements. Who
  owns the copyright to those works?  What rights does the university
  have to the work?
<p>
<LI>(d) Students may participate in research projects, and can be
  authors or co-authors on papers resulting from that research. Who
  owns the copyright to those works?  What rights does the university
  have to the work?
<p>
<LI>(e) There are commercial web sites that collect student class notes, and
  will pay students for copies of their notes. Is this acceptable by
  the university copyright policy?
<p>
<LI>(f) The ACM copyright transfer agreement refers to
  "work-made-for-hire" as a special case. Given the UNCG copyright
  policy, does this apply to papers written by UNCG faculty?
<p>
<LI>(g) After signing over copyright to ACM, can an author print and
  send a copy of their paper to a colleague?
<p>
<LI>(h) After signing over copyright to ACM, can an author post a copy
  of the paper on their own web page?
<p>
<LI>(i) After signing over copyright to ACM, can an author authorize a
  scholar at a different institution to post the paper on their
  web site?
<p>
<LI>(j) After signing over copyright to ACM, can a professor (not one of
  the authors) make copies of the paper to distribute to their class?
<p>
<LI>(k) Is a paper written by an author at UNCG considered "public
  domain" after it is published?
<p>
<LI>(l) Does the ACM transfer agreement or the ACM copyright statement
  give any rights to anyone other than the author(s) and ACM?
</UL>
<p>
<LI>This question refers to the following six research papers, two from
each of three main security conferences, which have been selected so
that they can be largely understood without a lot of specialized or
advanced knowledge. Each student has been assigned a subset of these
papers to use in answering the following questions (check Canvas for
your assignment).

</UL>
<p>
Answer the following questions regarding the papers you were assigned:
<UL style="list-style:none;"><p>
<LI>(a) One of your assigned papers is provided as a link to the ACM
  Digital Library. Try accessing this paper from on campus (using a
  UNCG computer) and from off campus. What are the results?
<p>
<LI>(b) The class handout on research in computer science described ways
  to locate copies of a paper that are available even if the "copy of
  record" requires a subscription to access.  How
  many freely-available copies can you find for the ACM-published
  paper that you were assigned? In addition to the number, give access
  information (URL) for two copies: one that clearly abides by the ACM
  copyright transfer agreement, and one that seems to violate
  copyright (there are examples of both for each paper!). Explain your
  reasoning about why each copy abides by or violates copyright.
<p>
<LI>(c) For each paper, use Google Scholar to find at least two papers that were
  published after the paper and build on the knowledge in some non-trivial
  way. To judge the "non-trivial" part you will have to access the
  papers and see how integral the paper is to the new work -- if a
  subsequent publication just mentions the paper in passing, 
  keep looking!
<p>
<LI>(d) For each paper, examine the structure of the paper and identify
  each of the seven "components of a research paper" that were
  described in the research handout. For each paper give a brief
  description of each component, describing things such as the length,
  whether the component is in a distinctly labeled section, and an
  indication of the technical depth of the component (can you make
  sense out of it by just a brief read/scan?).
<p>
<LI>(e) For each paper, understand as much as you can about the results
  by carefully reading the abstract and introduction, and then looking
  into the main body at whatever depth you are comfortable with. Then
  describe the results and significance in your own words (don't copy
  from the papers!). Keep notes, because after this homework is
  submitted we will go around the class and ask what people learned
  from each paper.
