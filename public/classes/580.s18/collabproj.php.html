<h1><center>Collaborative Research Projects</center></h1>

<P><P><P>Students will work in teams of 3-4 students to complete a semester-long
project. As an option for the Spring 2018 semester, we are doing a trial
of <EM><B>collaborative projects</B></EM> between CSC 580 (Cryptography
and Security in Computing) and ISM 324 (Secure Networked Systems).
Collaborative projects will consist of two students from each class, and
will explore a cloud storage security topic from a comprehensive view
that will include both technical and business requirements perspectives.
At the end of the semester, collaborative project teams will present
their work at a special event that will include industry
representatives, so it is a good chance to get some exposure with
potential future employers. Collaborative projects will also provide
good experience with the kinds of multidisciplinary teams that many of
you will work on after graduation, and offers a good experience to put
on your resume!
<H1><A NAME="cloud-storage-background">Cloud Storage Background</A></H1>

<P>Cloud storage services provide file storage facilities that are
accessible from anywhere on the Internet, and often include powerful
file sharing and collaboration features. The power and convenience of
cloud storage has led to widespread use of services such as Dropbox,
Box, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive. There are many security
issues related to cloud storage that we will explore in this class as
examples of concepts related to security goals, protections, and threat
models, and we will look into issues such as where the data is stored,
who has access to it, and what risks exist in various approaches to
cloud storage.
<P>Beyond general security issues associated with cloud storage, we will
focus on Nextcloud
(<A HREF="https://nextcloud.com"><CODE>https://nextcloud.com</CODE></A>), which
is a mature open source cloud storage system that includes features
comparable to the main service providers mentioned above. The
Nextcloud server can be installed and run on an organization's own
servers, or can be used with a special-purpose cloud storage
appliance, or can be used as a service (similar to Dropbox or Box)
that is offered by over 50 different providers. Clients exist for all
major desktop operating systems (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and mobile
operating systems (Android, Apple, and Windows).
<P>We focus on Nextcloud for two main reasons. First, it is open source and
very flexible, so the software can be examined and experimented with.
Second, versions due in early 2018, and available now in limited beta
testing releases, include a powerful feature that none of the big
services provide: end-to-end encryption. We will explore what this means
and how it is achieved over the course of the semester, culminating in
group projects where student teams examine and evaluate this new
capability from a security and/or efficiency standpoint.
<P>Collaborative projects will be organized around a theme or topic, and
will investigate both organizational/business needs aspects and
technical aspects. There is some flexibility in the exact choice of
project topic. Two topic suggestions are given below, and other topics
are possible with permission of the instructors (this is discouraged
unless you have a particularly creative or strong alternative topic).
<P>All collaborative projects require contacting an organization and doing
interviews with at least 5 employees (both technical and non-technical)
in order to learn about the organization's needs and use of cloud
storage, and a technical component looking at specific technologies and
solutions (down to the level of code review for Nextcloud).
<H1><A NAME="collaborative-project-topic-suggestions">Collaborative Project Topic
Suggestions</A></H1>

<P>The following are possible project topics for collaborative projects.
<P><B>Collaborative Project Idea 1: Technical - Requirements and
Solution Evaluation.</B><BR>This approach focuses on technical aspects of information security
protections, in the context of an organization (company or nonprofit)
that the team will work with. Researching cloud storage from a technical
perspective requires interviews about the organization's use and/or
planned use of cloud storage, sensitivity of data involved, and
organizational or other (e.g., legal) requirements on data protection.
The organizational research part of the project should include
interviews with at least 5 people, including both technical and
non-technical employees. The technical capabilities and security
protections offered by Nextcloud and at least one commercial provider
(Dropbox, Box, etc.) should then be evaluated and matched with the
requirements gathered from the organization. In the case of Nextcloud
you should include a technical evaluation of both the overall security
design and model, and an evaluation of the implementation that is
provided by Nextcloud.
<P><B>Collaborative Project Idea 2: User Issues - User Awareness and
Usability.</B><BR>Researching cloud storage from a user perspective requires preparing a
survey that is designed to see how well the organization's users
(including technical staff) understand "high level picture" of cloud
storage, including issues such as where data resides in the system and
the dangers involved in general systems of that type. The
survey/interview should then delve into some specific aspects of
Nextcloud and at least one other system, to see how well users
understand specific statements from user documentation, system options,
and potential error messages (if relevant). The team should interview at
least 5 people, including both technical and non-technical employees. If
such a system is currently in use at the organization, users should be
asked about their day-to-day practices with regard to system use and
data protection. The final report should include a comparison of user
perceptions and behavior to best practices, and should include
recommendations for improving proper use of security within the
organization.
<H1><A NAME="timeline-and-deliverables">Timeline and Deliverables</A></H1>

<P>Tuesday, January 16: Joint meeting of CSC 580 and ISM 324 to discuss the
project (location to be announced).
<P>Tuesday, February 6: Project Proposal<BR>Students will write a document describing which project idea their team
will perform for the project. Students will also identify the names of
organizations, roles and names of employees that they would like to
interview along with their contact information. Proposal should also
include a tentative schedule for completing the project.
<P>Tuesday, February 20: Project Plan<BR>Students should design a list of questions that they plan to use during
the interviews, and an outline of technical questions they will
investigate. Carefully read and understand the project idea before
designing the questions. This document should also include a schedule of
self-identified project milestones, including a tentative interview
schedule. All the interviews need to be completed by the date the
progress report is due.
<P>Tuesday, April 3: Progress Report<BR>The progress report should be a brief summary of progress on both
organizational/interview topics and technical investigations.
Students are required to write detailed notes during the interviews, and
the progress report should include transcriptions of the recorded
interviews.
<P>Tuesday, April 17: Final Project Report<BR>Students will write a 20-25 page paper related to the selected project.
Details about the paper contents are provided under each project idea
above. The paper should be written in Times New Roman, 12pt,
double-spaced font with one inch page margins. The page length does not
include interview notes; however, the transcribed notes should be
included in an Appendix at the end of the paper. Transcribed notes
should not be submitted to the organization to ensure the anonymity of
the interviewees. Students should use tables and images where
appropriate to make information easier to read. The paper should include
a 2-page executive summary that provides an overview of the interesting
findings and recommendations.
<P>Tuesday, April 24 - 6:00pm to 8:00pm: Final reception and presentations
for collaborative projects with industry representatives.
