<center><h1>Homework 1 &ndash; Due Tuesday, January 30</h1></center>

<P><P><P><I>Reminder:</I>
Homework problems are for you to develop skills and to practice. Once
you get a handle on solving these problems, think of generalizations
and practice those as well. Clear communication is as important as the
right technical idea, and you should write up your solutions clearly
so that they can be understood by a non-specialist (and non-mindreader!).
<P>Next Tuesday (Jan 30) we will discuss solutions. There will be a quiz on
Thursday (Feb 1) consisting of a single problem similar to one of
these.
<OL><LI>What are the main parts of a computer science research paper - list
each with a one sentence description of what purpose it serves.
<p>
<LI>Draw a system model, identifying data at various parts in the system,
for processing a credit card purchase in a store. I'm not expecting
you to know or report on how this <EM>actually</EM> works in stores
today, but I want you to think, from your own personal experience,
about the "pieces" in such a system and how they could work
together. Label where data resides or is transmitted in the system.
<p>
<LI>Use Euclid's algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of 84
and 58. Show your work!
</OL>
