<P><P><B>Catalog Description (from the current catalog - being
rewritten, and included here just for reference):</B> Modern
development of cryptography and secure encryption protocols. Program
security and viruses. Operating system protection. Network and
distributed system security. Database security. Administering
security.
<P><P><B>Prerequisites:</B>
Grades of at least C (2.0) in CSC 330 and CSC 350.
<P><P><B>Student Learning Outcomes:</B> 
Upon successful completion, students will be able to
<UL><LI>describe basic cryptographic functionality, including symmetric
  ciphers, public key encryption, digital signatures, hash functions,
  and related concepts;  <LI>describe how basic cryptographic building blocks are combined to
  meet high-level security goals in protocols like SSL and IPsec;  <LI>identify specific security technologies that can improve aspects
  of a system design;  <LI>justify the use of particular technologies, settings, and
  parameters to meet specified security goals;  <LI>evaluate the security of systems that use cryptography and secure
  communication techniques;  <LI>discuss how security and privacy issues can impact system design;  <LI>(Graduate students) independently explore research-level
  computer security and cryptography topics.
</UL>
<P><P><B>Textbook:</B>  William Stallings.  <A HREF="http://www.williamstallings.com/Cryptography/index.html"><I>Cryptography and Network
  Security: Principles and Practice (7th Edition)</I></A>.  Pearson/Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River,
NJ, 2017.
<P><B>Other Reading:</B>  
Some topics will involve reading supplemental
materials, including instructor-written handouts and published
materials. These materials will be handed out as printed material, or
will be available electronically from the class web page.
<P><P><B>Class Structure and Assignments:</B> The primary method of
instruction will be two 75-minute meetings per week that will consist
of regular quizzes, lecture, discussion, and problem-solving sessions.
The class structure is described below.
<P><P><I>Ungraded Homework:</I> On most weeks, students will be
given approximately 3 written (non-programming) homework problems on
Thursday. These problems will be representative of the kinds of
written problems you would traditionally see on an exam -- the first
time you see the problem it might take some time and effort to figure
out how to solve the problem, but once you have mastered the material
and practiced you should be able to solve similar problems in around
10 minutes. These should be solved before the following Tuesday, when
solutions will be reviewed and discussed. These problems are not
graded, but are not optional! If you do not <EM>work out</EM> solutions
yourself (and study and practice), then it is unlikely that you will
be able to solve the quiz problems, which <EM>do</EM> count for a
significant part of your grade.
<P><P><I>Quizzes:</I> One week after each set of written problems are
assigned, class will begin with a quiz in which students will be given
one problem similar to the ones assigned the previous week as homework
problems. A typical problem will be designed to be solvable in 10
minutes, and students will be given 15 minutes, so time should not be
an issue. While these problems are based on the homework problems,
they will not be identical. If you <EM>understand</EM> the solutions to
the homework problems and have <EM>practice</EM> solving similar
problems, then you shouldn't have any problems with the
quizzes. However, if you do not work out solutions to the homework on
your own, thinking you can rely on the in-class solution discussion
(or other solutions you locate when studying), then you
probably will not do well. There will be approximately 10
quizzes, and your two lowest grades will be dropped. There
will be no quizzes given at other times for any reason (make-up or
in-advance), and if you miss class on a particular day that will need
to be one of your dropped scores. 
<P><P><I>Graded Homework:</I> Throughout the semester there will be 3-4
graded homework assignments. These will consist of a few selected
problems that go deeper than can be done with problems that are
designed as 10 minute quiz problems.
<P><P><I>Guided Research Project:</I> Throughout the semester, we will
use cloud storage security as a concrete example of various
security and privacy topics. This will be focused around a discussion
of research in computer science and security, and students will work
in teams of 3-4 people to complete a research project related to the security
of cloud storage. As an option for the Spring 2018 semester, we are
doing a trial of <EM><B>collaborative projects</B></EM> between CSC
580 (Cryptography and Security in Computing) and ISM 324 (Secure
Networked Systems), with a topic related to cloud storage
security. Students in CSC 580 who do not opt for a collaborative
project can complete a pure <EM><B>technical project</B></EM> in teams
of just CSC 580 students. We will discuss this project and the
collaborative team approach during a combined meeting with the ISM 324
class on Tuesday, January 16.
<P><P><I>Final Exam:</I> There will be a traditional final exam, designed
around all of the homework problems that are assigned throughout the
semester. The final exam will be held at the university-scheduled day
and time: <B><I>Thursday, May 3, 3:30pm - 6:30pm</I></B>.
<P><P><I>Graduate Students - Independent Research:</I> Graduate students
will take the research component one step further, by independently
studying a second research topic in addition to the guided research in
cloud storage that all students will pursue. In mid-March, Graduate
students will select a topic in consultation with the instructor,
based on their own interests, identify appropriate research materials,
research the topic, and submit a final paper that surveys current
research related to that topic. The final paper is due at the time of
the final exam (May 3).
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Final grades will be calculated
based on the following weighting.

<P><P><B>Attendance Policy and In-class Behavior:</B> Be a grown-up,
respect other students, and be responsible for your own
actions. That's it. If further interpretation or enforcement of these
principles is needed, the instructor has the final word.
<P><P><B>University Closings:</B>  If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Canvas site for information about if and how the class will
proceed. 
<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B>   Students are expected to be familiar
with and abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online
at 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>
While research projects will be done in teams, graded homeworks are
individual assignments, and your submissions must be 100% your own
work.  It is also important that you clearly cite <EM>any</EM> source of
material other than the textbook or in-class discussions that
influences your solution. This includes any online videos, tutorials,
or other sources of information -- if it didn't come from your own
head and your own creativity, you need to give credit for where the
ideas came from.
