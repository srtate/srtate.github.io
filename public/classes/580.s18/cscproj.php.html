<h1><center>CS-Specific Research Projects</center></h1>

<P><P><P>Students in CSC 580 will work in teams of 3-4 students to complete a
semester-long project. As an option for the Spring 2018 semester, we are
doing a trial of <EM><B>collaborative projects</B></EM> between CSC 580
(Cryptography and Security in Computing) and ISM 324 (Secure Networked
Systems), with a topic related to cloud storage security. Background on
cloud storage and information about collaborative projects are provided
in a separate handout. Students in CSC 580 who do not opt for a
collaborative project can complete a pure <EM><B>technical
project</B></EM> in teams of 3-4 CSC 580 students. These teams are also
strongly encouraged to focus their project on a topic in security of
cloud storage, but can pick another topic of similar depth with the
permission of the instructor. Project depth should be appropriate for
the student level (advanced undergraduate or master's student): while
projects must follow the style and structure of real computer science
research, there is no expectation that research "make a contribution to
the field" as a real research project would.
<P>Technical project reports are expected to follow the standards of
computer science and computer security research, both in terms of focus
and structure, and must be formatted to computer science publication
standards (standard IEEE conference paper formatting templates will be
provided for both Word and LaTeX, providing regular two column
single-spaced papers). The length should be 12-15 pages in this format.
One CSC 580 class day will be devoted to discussing computer science
research practices and standards, and students will explore aspects of
this in a homework assignment early in the semester.
<H1><A NAME="technical-project-topic-suggestions">Technical Project Topic
Suggestions</A></H1>

<P>The following are project topic suggestions for technical projects.
<P><B>Technical Project Idea 1: Robust efficiency evaluation</B><BR>For a project of this type, the team should design a test suite and
efficiency evaluation mechanism to thoroughly evaluate Nextcloud and at
least one other cloud storage service. Test cases should include
variations on the number of files (up to approximately 10,000 files) and
file size, and comparisons of unencrypted and encrypted storage (as
allowed by the systems under evaluation). Efficiency should include
measures of CPU and network usage. Ideally, this project should result
in a model that can predict the processor and network bandwidth
requirements based on environment parameters.
<P><B>Technical Project Idea 2: Comparison of Nextcloud with composed
end-to-end solutions</B><BR>For this project, Nextcloud security and efficiency will be compared to
solutions that use both an unencrypted cloud storage solution (e.g.,
Dropbox, Box, or Google Drive) and an encrypted filesystem to gain
similar security benefits. For example, in Linux a user might stack an
encrypted filesystems such as EncFS or eCryptfs on top of a cloud
sync'ed directory. In addition to security and efficiency evaluations,
you should also address issues of portability and use across different
desktop OSes and mobile devices.
<P><B>Technical Project Idea 3: Proposing and testing extensions to
Nextcloud e2e encryption</B><BR>The early release of Nextcloud end-to-end encryption has some two
significant issues. First, nested directories (directories inside
directories) are not possible in the Android client, and it's not clear
how they are handled in the Linux desktop client. Second, copying or
moving a file from an unencrypted folder to an encrypted folder within a
single Nextcloud repository does not encrypt the file in the
supposedly-encrypted folder (technically this is because the client only
issues WebDAV copy/move commands to the server, which makes an identical
copy). A project team can propose, implement, and evaluate a trial
solution to either of these problems.
<P><B>Technical Project Idea 4: Providing assurance to the end user</B><BR>A big benefit of end-to-end encryption is that the end user does not
need to trust the cloud storage provider. However, the end-user must
trust the client software provider, including any update mechanism
provided with the software. How does the user know that there is not
just an illusion of security, while the client software actually
provides a backdoor for dishonest parties to gain access to the data? A
backdoor can be inserted either in the original software installation or
surreptitiously installed through a software update. Unlike the other
topic ideas, it is not clear how this problem can be solved, but a
project team can come up with one or two ideas and do a careful
evaluation of how they would work. A couple of ideas to consider are
third-party software certification (and signing), or some type of
self-certifying or proof-carrying code (most likely for a small part of
the overall code). This is a highly-speculative topic, and will require
more ingenuity and creativity to solve than the other topics.
<H1><A NAME="timeline-and-deliverables">Timeline and Deliverables</A></H1>

<P>Tuesday, January 16: Joint meeting of CSC 580 and ISM 324 to discuss
collaborative project possibilities (location to be announced).
<P>Tuesday, February 6: Project Proposal<BR>Students submit a document describing the project that their team will
undertake. Students must provide a brief outline of the approach they
plan to take, at a sufficient level to specify which aspects take an
experimental approach and which are more analysis/design focused.
<P>Tuesday, February 20: Project Plan<BR>The project plan fills in details that were outlined in the project
proposal, providing specifics on approaches that will be taken. Students
must identify at least three relevant references from the published
research literature, and for each one provide a full citation along with
a brief description of the paper's results and how the paper relates to
the project. The project plan should also include a schedule of
self-identified project milestones, where each milestone is a specific
and clear deliverable.
<P>Tuesday, April 3: Progress Report<BR>The progress report should be a brief summary of progress, and an early
draft of the project report. The project should be far enough along by
this point where the report should include the full introduction and
prior work sections (some statements in the introduction that describe
final results can be incomplete or placeholder statements, to be
finished after all results have been obtained). The results section(s)
should be included, but can be outlines with placeholder notes (e.g.,
"table of timing experiment results will go here").
<P>Tuesday, April 17: Final Project Report<BR>As described above, students will complete and submit a full
research-style paper, using a standard research paper template. All
components of a standard research paper should be present (introduction,
prior work summary, results, discussion, and conclusion/open problems),
and the paper should be 12-15 pages. The paper should include a 1-2
paragraph abstract, as described in the template.
<P><B>Sample Grading Rubric</B>
<P><EM>Research Design (40%):</EM> Interesting and substantial research
questions were formulated, and an appropriate research approach designed
to address the research questions. The research procedure is documented
so that it is clear, reproducible, and gives results that can be trusted
as answers to the research questions.
<P><EM>Results presentation and discussion (30%):</EM> Results presented in
a clear and understandable form, using tables, charts, and graphs as
appropriate. Prior work section and results discussion clearly represent
the results, how they support research findings, and how they fit into
the existing body of knowledge. Conclusion and open problems are stated that
clearly describe what results are closed and suggests directions for
future directions and extensions of the work.
<P><EM>Paper Organization and Clarity/ Presentation (15%):</EM> The paper
includes all standard research paper components (introduction, prior
work summary, results, discussion, and conclusion with open problems),
with an abstract that summarizes the most important parts and results of
the paper. The paper uses headings and the information flows well from
one section to the next. The writing is clear and correct.
<P><EM>Milestones Completed On-time (15%):</EM> All of the milestones were
completed by the specified dates and were thorough.
