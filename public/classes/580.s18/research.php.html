<h1><center>Research in Computer Science and Computer Security</center></h1>

<P><P><P>This handout gives a broad overview of how the computer science
research community operates, with specific information regarding 
computer security and cryptography research toward the end of the
document. Many computer science students are very focused on
applications of computer science and software development, and as a
result have only indirect exposure to the science research that
forms the core of the discipline. This handout and the corresponding
class discussion are designed to open your eyes to the fascinating
world of computer science research!
<P>First a little background on terminology: scholars regularly talk about
"disciplines" and "fields of study" (or just "fields"). A
<EM>discipline</EM> is a high-level characterization of an area of
knowledge or study, and academic departments are typically organized
around disciplines. Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science
are all disciplines. While some people use <EM>field</EM> as a synonym
for a discipline, it more commonly refers to a more specialized focus
of study. At least in computer science, research communities generally
organize around fields, with separate conferences and meetings for
different fields. Theoretical computer science, programming languages,
operating systems, computer security, cryptography, and networking are
all fields, and there are specific conferences for each. If you look
at the core curriculum of most science disciplines, you'll typically
see courses organized around fields within that discipline. Notice
that some fields are entirely within a single discipline, while others
cross disciplines. Cryptography is mostly within computer science, but
there are a substantial number of mathematicians that work in the field as
well. The field of networking is pretty evenly split between the
disciplines of computer science and electrical engineering.  Beyond
disciplines and fields, people sometimes refer to more specialized 
"sub-fields" -- for example, computational geometry is a sub-field
of theoretical computer science, which is a field of computer
science. While computer science conferences are generally organized
around fields, smaller meetings and workshops are often organized 
around sub-fields so that more focused discussions and work can take
place. 
<H1><A NAME="1">What is Research in Computer Science?</A></H1>
<P>The word <EM>research</EM> is used to mean different things in different
contexts, which can be confusing at first.  Students at the high
school and college level are often assigned "research papers," which
involve finding sources of information and pulling that together in a
coherent paper that summarizes this information. People refer to this
as "researching a topic," but that is very different from what a
scientist means by "doing research." When a scientist does research,
they are looking to ask and answer questions that haven't been
answered before. You won't find answers in the library or books or
online since the questions haven't been answered yet: you have to
figure out the answers yourself!
<P>There are three main kinds of questions that people seek to answer in
research: well-known questions that no one has been able to answer
(called "open problems"); questions no one has thought to ask before
because they represent a new and creative way of looking at a topic;
and questions that take a logical step in gaining knowledge, but which
no one has gotten around to answering yet. The vast majority of
research if of this last type, and this research helps complete our
knowledge in important ways. Developing algorithms that are
incremental improvements of existing "best algorithms" falls in this
category, as does testing algorithms in new contexts.
<P>The first type of question, well-known "open problems," are problems
that have been asked and examined by many people, but don't have
answers yet. For example, "Does there exist a polynomial time
algorithm for factoring large integers?" Or "What is the fastest
algorithm for multiplying <I>n&#215;n</I> matrices?" Or the big one: "Is
<I>P</I> equal to <I>NP</I>?" The fact that these questions have been asked
many times without being solved, is evidence that they are extremely
difficult to solve. Some, such as the <I>P</I> vs <I>NP</I> question, have
received a lot of attention from the very best minds in the computer
science world, so solving them would require a significant
breakthrough in thinking.
<P>The second type of question, questions no one has thought to ask
before, range from interesting new outlooks on existing problems, to
breakthrough creativity that can start entire new sub-fields. For
example, in 1985 Sleator and Tarjan explored the utility of analyzing
algorithms on streaming data using a new measure they invented, which
was later named the "competitive ratio." This observation led to so
many interesting new insights that it spawned an entire sub-field:
competitive analysis of online algorithms.
<H1><A NAME="2">Styles of Research: Basic versus Applied</A></H1>
<P>Scientists often talk about basic research versus applied research,
depending on the kinds of questions that are asked, and what is valued
as a result. Most research contains some components of both basic and
applied research, so it's not an "either/or" characterization. 
<DL><DT><B><I>Basic Research.</I></B><DD> Basic research focuses on
  fundamental questions of understanding and knowledge, and whether
  the results can be applied is not important. It's not that basic
  research research results <EM>can't</EM> have applications, but rather
  that is not the driving force. For example, a physicist
  might study string theory -- not because it has potential
  applications, but because it helps us understand how the universe
  works. In computer science, one of the most important (if not
  <EM>the</EM> most important) unsolved research question is the
  question of whether or not <I>P=NP</I>. A constructive proof that <I>P=NP</I> would
  almost certainly have earth-shattering practical applications, but
  pursuing the question on its own is a fundamental basic research
  question. One other characteristic of basic research is that it
  tends to be very general-purpose, since it explores more fundamental
  questions, and is not tightly tied to any particular context or
  application. Like any style of research, basic research aims to be
  useful. It's just that "useful" here means in terms of insight and
  use for other research within the field, not necessarily in
  producing new products or technologies.
<DT><B><I>Applied Research.</I></B><DD> The goal of applied
  research is finding discoveries that could lead to new
  technologies or products. For example, research into speech
  recognition algorithms has clear applications that go beyond
  intellectual curiosity. Sometimes applied research is very tightly
  focused, such as evaluation of machine learning algorithms for
  detecting patients at risk for diabetes. Such application-focused
  research may not be useful outside of that particular setting, but
  that does not detract from the usefulness within that setting. Note
  that "applied research" refers to the focus of the research, not a
  particular end-product. In particular, the research does not need to
  lead to a new product in order to be applied research. Investigating
  speech recognition algorithms is applied research whether it leads
  to production-quality software or not. People who do applied
  research often use the term <EM>technology transfer</EM> to talk about
  applied research that is then turned into a new product or technology,
  and issues of <EM>intellectual property</EM> and <EM>patents</EM> come
  into the picture when looking at technology transfer.
</DL>
<H1><A NAME="3">Science Research - Publication and Peer Review</A></H1>
<P>The end-goal of research is to learn or discover something new, and to
share that so it can make an impact. In general science research, the
sharing is open and public, with the goal of advancing knowledge.
Industry research (or "research and
development": R&amp;D) can be different.
While some companies have prominent research groups that
publish their work openly (e.g., Microsoft Research, IBM Research,
...), many have R&amp;D groups that work to make discoveries that are
used in products and services, or help the company
operate better. Like all research, industry projects try to answer
questions, but the questions can be quite different from science
research. For example, an internal industry research project might
ask how different technologies meet the company's needs, or what risks
they might pose to the company's operations and assets. In the Spring
2018 CSC 580 class, the "collaborative project" option reflects this
kind of industry research project.
<P>For general science research, where the goal is to advance knowledge
in the field, results should be shared as widely as possible,
and this is the role that conferences, journals, and books play in any
research community.  Computer science is a somewhat unique discipline
in its emphasis on conference publication, so be aware that scholars
in other disciplines often find this very strange. In some
disciplines, conferences are for short abstracts (2-4 pages) where
the goal is simply to stimulate
discussion, and full research products are saved for publication in
scholarly journals. By contrast, computer science conferences
typically publish full, completed research products.
<P>Integral to the notion of scientific publication, is the process of
<EM>peer review</EM>. When a scientist submits a manuscript for
publication, the people in charge of the publication (conference or
journal) identify experts in the topic that is being investigated, and
send the manuscript to those experts (called "reviewers" or
"referees") who read and evaluate the work. The reviewers
specifically consider questions such as: "Does this work make a
substantial contribution to the field?"  "Is the work high quality
(mathematically correct and/or with a solid experimental design)?"
"Is the writing clear and understandable?" The level a work must
rise to in order to be a "substantial contribution to the field"
depends on the venue it is submitted to. Top-tier publications
expect work to be ground-breaking, but there are many publications
that have less stringent requirements. However, even less selective
publications expect some contribution that advances the state of
knowledge in the field.
<H1><A NAME="4">Conferences in Computer Science</A></H1>
<P>In computer science, conference papers at top conferences are usually
complete research products, typically 12-15 pages long, and are
carefully and thoroughly refereed with only the very best research
papers being accepted to the conference.  Computer science conferences
can be extremely competitive. For example, the 2017 <EM>IEEE
  Symposium on Security and Privacy</EM> had 457 papers submitted, from
which 60 (about 13%) were accepted for the conference. Presenting
work at such a top-tier conference is often a significant
career-making move for a beginning researcher, as the papers are
typically seen as the best research in the world, and it is presented
before an audience that has the top researchers in the world present.
<P>Of course, presenting a full research paper at a top research
conference isn't the only way to disseminate your research.  Many
conferences, including some of the top-tier ones, allow people to
submit less stringently reviewed work to be presented at poster
session (basically a reception at the conference where attendees
circulate through a room looking at posters describing work and
talking with researchers). Poster sessions are particularly good for
students just starting out in research, because it is a way to get
your work out and seen, and to meet and talk with other
researchers. At top conferences, you might even find yourself chatting
with a Turing Award winner about your research, which is a pretty
amazing experience! Some conferences also have "short paper" or
"work in progress" tracks, which are in between posters and full
papers as far as depth and prestige. A researcher with a solid but not
ground-breaking research result will often have to decide whether to
present a short paper at a top conference or a full paper at a less
selective conference. These can be tough decisions!
<P>Beyond the top-tier conferences, there are a <EM>lot</EM> of other
conferences. Some conferences focus on a specific sub-field (e.g., the
<EM>Conference on Public Key Cryptography (PKC)</EM>), some are simply less
competitive general conferences that encourage larger participation
(e.g., the <EM>Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS)</EM>, with
an a 2016 acceptance rate of 26%), and some focus on regional research
communities (e.g., the European Symposium on Research in Computer
  Security (ESORICS)). While not "top-tier," some of these conferences are
very high quality. The web site
<A HREF="http://www.conferenceranks.com"><CODE>http://www.conferenceranks.com</CODE></A>
reports on conference quality ratings for established conferences
using several sources of data. For example, the <EM>IEEE Symposium
  on Security and Privacy</EM> has a Qualis rank of "A1" (the top
rating) while <EM>ESORICS</EM> and <EM>PKC</EM> have "A2" ratings (still
excellent, but not top-tier), and <EM>CANS</EM> has a "B" rating
(still good!). If you want your work to make an impact, it is best to
avoid conferences with a "C" rating. Conferences that are unlisted
are either too new to have established a track record (common for
emerging fields!) or are not taken seriously as research conferences.
<P>As a final warning, there are science conferences
(in computer science and other fields) that serious researchers will
refer to as "scam conferences," "fake conferences," or sometimes
"predatory conferences." As the scientific community has gotten more
competitive professionally, with a strong "publish or
perish" culture at research universities, people have set up
conferences that will accept almost any paper submitted so that
researchers can add a publication to their record. The organizers set
these up to make money off registration fees, and the presenters often
don't even show up to present their work. What do I mean when I say
they will "accept almost any paper submitted?" In 2005, three MIT
students put this to the test by
<A HREF="http://news.mit.edu/2015/how-three-mit-students-fooled-scientific-journals-0414">writing a program that generated a random
  paper</A>

-- it was complete gibberish, but was mostly-correct English that
used popular buzz-words, and the paper was accepted to the <EM>World
  Multiconference on Systems, Cybernetics, and Informatics</EM>. This is
clearly not the kind of conference that a serious researcher would
want to be associated with, but unfortunately it is not the only
instance of this happening. Some fake conference/journal
publishers are aggressive in reaching out to researchers asking them to
submit papers, sometimes fraudulently listing prominent researchers (without
their permission) as being associated with the conference.
Established researchers can often recognize these
without too much difficulty, but beginning researchers should always
check conference rankings or check with a trusted
colleague before taking such a solicitation at face value.
<H1><A NAME="5">Structure of a Research Paper</A></H1>
<P>Over the years, a more-or-less standard structure has evolved for
computer science research papers, with all papers addressing certain
specific points.
<UL><LI><I>Abstract.</I> Papers always have an "abstract," a short 1-2
paragraph summary that gives a concise summary of the results of the
paper (what was found, and why it is important). When a researcher is
trying to find papers that might be interesting in a recent
conference, he or she might go through and read all the abstracts to see
which ones they want to look into further.
<LI><I>Introduction.</I> The paper itself
always starts with an "Introduction" section that informally
describes the problem addressed, why it is important, and summarizes
the results of the paper. Introductions are typically 1-2 pages, so
go into more depth than is possible in an abstract.
<LI><I>Prior Work.</I> The significance of a research result depends
on how the work extends or improves upon what is currently
known. Therefore, an important part of the paper is a
"Prior Work" section that summarizes the current state of 
knowledge related to the topic, typically drawing explicit
comparisons to how the new work is different from or better than previous
work.
<LI><I>Formal Definitions, Techniques, and Results.</I>  This is
  the main technical part of the paper, where problems are defined
  formally, along with appropriate notation as needed. An important
  goal for any research work is that the results should be
  <EM>verifiable</EM> and <EM>reproducible</EM>, so enough detail must be
  provided so that other researchers could recreate the research and
  validate the results.  For experimental work in computer science,
  this means that all parts of the experimental set-up must be clearly
  described, including type(s) of computers/CPUs, operating system,
  amount of memory available, versions of compilers, etc. For work
  that includes data analysis, data should be maintained by the
  researcher in case questions arise about the research -- while
  making data publicly available is encouraged, in some cases either
  privacy or intellectual property issues prevent publishing the data,
  but it should be retained by the author regardless. Results of the
  paper should be clearly stated, as appropriate for the work (proofs
  for theoretical work, tables and graphs showing experimental
  results, etc.).
<LI><I>Discussion.</I>
The discussion section puts the results into context, and describes
why the researcher feels the results are significant. For experimental
work, it is important to "make sense" out of any data that has been
presented, explaining any anomalies or curiosities that arose in the
experiments and explaining the significance in context of other known
work.
<LI><I>Conclusion and Future Work/Open Questions.</I>
The conclusion is a high level recap of the results, which is often
similar to the brief summary provided in the abstract. It is rare that
any research paper would be the absolute final word on the topic being
investigated, and researchers often will describe what they believe
are promising directions for improving or extending the
work. Sometimes these are indications of what the authors are working
on next, and sometimes these are suggestions to other researchers that
might want to see if they can extend the work.
<LI><I>References.</I>
Full citations to relevant related work are provided, particularly to
work described in the Prior Work section. As everyone who had to write
papers in high school knows, citations follow very specific content
and formatting requirements. There is no "standard format" in
computer science, and each publisher has their own required
format. For authors who use LaTeX to write their papers (common in
computer science), the BibTeX tool provides an easy way to keep
track of references and automatically format them according to
different standards.
</UL>
<H1><A NAME="6">Accessing Publications - Copyrights, Open Access, etc.</A></H1>
<P>Accessing published research has changed dramatically in the past few
decades. Thirty years ago, papers were distributed in printed form,
which were purchased primarily by libraries. Printing and distributing
research publications was expensive, so academic publishers protected
their business interests by having authors sign over copyright to
their work as a condition of getting their work published,
and anyone that wanted a copy would need to pay the
publisher for a copy.
<P>While there were ways to electronically distribute research papers in
the 1980's, they were not widely used. However, when the world wide
web was invented in the early 1990's, this changed
everything. Researchers, particularly in computer science, almost
immediately set up personal web pages that could be easily located and
used to distribute their work. Peer review was still important, but
researchers could distribute copies from their own web
sites. Publishers adapted by changing copyright agreements so that
authors now typically retain the right to distribute their own work
from their web pages. Not all authors distribute their work like this,
however, so libraries still subscribe to journals and conference
proceedings -- although those subscriptions are now for digital
publications, such as the ACM Digital Library or the IEEE Xplore
Digital Library. For example, the UNCG library subscribes to the ACM
Digital Library, and UNCG students and faculty can access any of those
publications from a UNCG IP address, or by logging in to the library
web site and going through their proxy.
<P>Another big change in research publishing started in the early 2000s,
with the move toward "open access publishing." In this publishing
model, publishers provide copies of research papers freely from their
web site, without requiring a subscription. Since publishers can't
rely on subscription fees in an open access model, costs are shifted
to the authors, who pay a fee to have their work published (typically
$500 to $1000). Even though publishers don't serve as an exclusive
gateway to research in this model, they still manage the peer review
process that is vital for ensuring quality.
<P>There are also open publication collections that authors can submit
work to, such as the Cornell arXiv e-Print repository
(<A HREF="https://arxiv.org"><CODE>https://arxiv.org</CODE></A> - currently
hosting over a million papers in physics, mathematics, and computer
science) and the IACR Cryptology ePrint archive
(<A HREF="https://eprint.iacr.org"><CODE>https://eprint.iacr.org</CODE></A> -
with over 10,000 papers in cryptology).  Note that the work in these
archives is not peer reviewed, so the quality varies widely. These are
often good places to find early versions of work, or slightly expanded
work of papers that had been published in a peer-reviewed conference.
<H1><A NAME="7">How to Find Relevant Work</A></H1>
<P>There are a few tricks to finding relevant work when it comes to doing
research on a particular topic. A researcher often becomes interested in a
research problem based on reading a published paper (or several
related papers) and being interested in adding to what is known about
that topic. Describing how the paper fits into the current state of
knowledge at the time it was published was the author's job, and if
they provided a good "Prior Work" section then getting a full
understanding of how the work fits in involves reading that section
and following up with locating and reading the most relevant papers
cited in that section.
<P>As you start out investigating a topic, it is also important to find
what relevant work was done <EM>after</EM> the paper was published, and
the best tool for that task is Google Scholar
(<A HREF="http://scholar.google.com"><CODE>http://scholar.google.com</CODE></A>).
Just like the regular Google search engine allows a user to search
through web pages, Google Scholar provides a way to search through
published research papers, and does a great job of indexing the
"References" section of those papers. The following screenshot shows
what the search result for a paper that was published in the
<EM>ACM Conference on Computer and Communication Security</EM> related to
cloud storage:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CENTER>
<img src="GS-Screenshot.png" />
</CENTER></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the bottom there is a link that says "Cited by 49," meaning that
there are 49 papers written <EM>after</EM> this paper that
cited it -- perhaps as part of the "Prior Work" section of
the newer paper! Clicking on that link will bring up the list of all 49 of these
papers, and you can explore to see what others have done to extend or
improve upon this paper. The first step is to read through the
abstracts of those 49 papers to see which ones are really relevant to
your work. If you started this search with a specific idea you wanted
to pursue for your own research, this is a vital step in making sure
that someone else hasn't beat you to it!
<P>Also note the link at the top right of the Google Scholar search
results, labeled "<CODE>[PDF] mit.edu</CODE>". This is a link to the copy
that the author is distributing freely from their home page.
While the "official" version of this paper is in the ACM Digital
Library, which you need a subscription to access, Google Scholar is a
good way to find other copies of the paper that can be accessed.
<H1><A NAME="8">Research in Computer Security and Cryptography</A></H1>
<P>Research in computer security is published almost exclusively in
conferences. While there are some journals (most notably the <EM>ACM
Transactions on Information and System Security</EM> and the <EM>IEEE
Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing</EM>), most research
appears only in conferences. While there are dozens of solid security
conferences, the following four are the top ones:
<UL><LI><A HREF="https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE182"><I>ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and
    Communication Security (CCS)</I></A><BR>Held every Fall, this is the major international security
  conference sponsored by <EM>ACM</EM>. Most work published at CCS has
  both basic and applied research components, and usually has broader
  appeal than a sub-field. For example, cryptography research may
  appear at CCS, but typically only if it has a strong applied
  component. More esoteric research in cryptography, which might be of
  interest just to other cryptographers, would not usually be
  presented at CCS (it would more likely be at CRYPTO).
<LI><A HREF="http://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/sp/index.html"><EM>IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy
    (S&amp;P)</EM></A><BR>Held
  every Spring, with a very similar focus and feel to CCS. In some
  ways this is the <EM>IEEE</EM> version of <EM>ACM</EM>'s CCS, although
  the acceptance ratio of S&amp;P is typically a little lower (and hence
  the prestige is marginally higher). For decades, this conference was
  held at the Claremont Hotel in Oakland, and so you'll often hear
  security researchers refer to this as the "Oakland conference"
  even though it hasn't been held in Oakland since 2011.
<LI><A HREF="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/108"><EM>USENIX Security
    Symposium</EM></A><BR>This
  is the top highly-applied security research conference, held every
  August. The majority of papers presented at USENIX report on
  software that has been created, which is also released. While the
  goal of most science research is to have people think "that's an
  interesting insight," the standard for USENIX is often
  "that <EM>does</EM> something cool." The research standard is still high:
  this is not the place to just report on some new piece of software,
  unless that software does something in a substantially new or
  unexpected way. 
<LI><A HREF="http://www.iacr.org/conferences/"><EM>CRYPTO: International Cryptology
    Conference</EM></A><BR>Held at the
  University of California at Santa Barbara every August since 1981,
  this is the top conference focused entirely on cryptography,
  featuring both basic and applied research. Papers range from applied
  to esoteric and highly mathematical.
</UL>
While the focus of this handout has been on
scientific research, note that computer science is not just a field of science,
but is also a field of practice. In addition to the science research
meetings, there are
professional and practice-oriented conferences 
such as the annual RSA Conference, DEFCON, BlackHat, and
more. These conferences typically host presentations and discussion
sessions, but don't publish papers in the way that scientific
conferences do.
