<center><h1>CSC 580 Ongoing Project &ndash; Basic Information</h1></center>

<P><P><P>During the course of the semester, you will develop the core
communication/management library for a secure online chat system. This
library will be implemented in Java, using the Java Cryptography
Architecture (JCA), which is standard and common across desktop,
server, and mobile Java platforms (including Android). The project is
broken into pieces, assigned every 2-3 weeks, that will involve
design and analysis of security and efficiency, experimental testing
of algorithms and JCA components to aid in design decision-making, and
implementation of core functionality. The project will focus on
information and communication issues, and we will not spend time
working on a user interface. You can view this as a secure
communication library that could be used by any user front-end. The
chat clients will make use of a "chat hub," which is a server that can
connect and provide services to users. The exact functionality and trust
requirements of the hub will be determined in the design phase.
<P>There are certain requirements that the system must meet, as well as
some decisions that will be made after in-class discussion.
At each "decision point" we will take the best ideas
from the class, and standardize on that design for everyone moving
forward.
<P><P><B>Security Requirements:</B> The system must 
<UL><LI>Support message sizes from small SMS-sized text messages to
  large multimedia messages (e.g., pictures)
<LI>Protect the confidentiality of messages so that only the
  intended recipients can get any meaningful information about message
  contents
<LI>Protect the integrity of messages so that the recipient has
  assurance that the message they view is the same message the sender
  sent  
<LI>Provide assurance that the person you are chatting with is the
  person you are intending to chat with
</UL>
<P><P><B>Other Considerations:</B> Questions to resolve through class
discussion include
<UL><LI>How much should the chat hub be trusted with identities and keys?
<LI>Is there a way to securely back up secret keys and identities?
<LI>Should the system disguise who is chatting with whom?
<LI>Should it be possible to see old messages (technically, do we
  provide forward security)?
</UL>
