    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CSC 580 Midterm Information</H1>

<P><P><P><P>The CSC 580 midterm will cover material from Chapters 1-6 in the
textbook, and the two outside readings (available on the web
page). Questions will deal with definitions/terminology, short answer
questions testing concepts, and problems to work out.
<P>To review, I would suggest first going through the "Key Terms" and
"Review Questions" at the end of each chapter, as well as the
chapter reading questions that I distributed for each chapter. I would
strongly recommend working on solutions to the chapter reading
questions in Piazza -- I will check Piazza regularly, and when there
is a good answer for any of these questions, I will mark it as a
"Good Answer" I will also give suggestions for answers that need
improvement.
<P>Beyond those basic questions, review your homeworks and the feedback I
gave on your answers. I won't give you problems as hard as the
homework problems that you haven't seen yet, but I might give you a
variant of a homework problem that had been assigned -- so understand
the correct answers!
<P>Finally, I will add a few additional questions to Piazza, similar to
the type and level of problems that you'll see on the midterm. These
are good practice, so you are encouraged to work on them! What follows
is a quick outline of what I think are the most important topics in
each chapter. This is <EM>not</EM> a complete list of things you need
to know!
<p><DL><DT><B>Chapter 1 - Overview.</B><DD>  The purpose of this chapter is to
  introduce basic concepts and terminology, and to give a good "big
  picture" of computer security. The most important parts of this
  chapter are terminology as it is used to classify security goals,
  types of attacks, etc.
<p><DT><B>Chapter 2 - Classical Encryption Techniques.</B><DD> The important
  aspect of this chapter is to get you thinking about cryptography in
  simple terms. The classical ciphers aren't really important in and
  of themselves, with a few exceptions: (1) you should understand the
  basic concept of a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, and the
  modular arithmetic properties that were revealed by considering
  affine ciphers with "mod 26" arithmetic; and (2) the one-time pad
  is important.
<p><DT><B>Chapter 3 - Block Ciphers and the Data Encryption Standard.</B><DD> 
While DES is not used a lot these days, there are some very important
concepts introduced in this chapter, including operations on binary
values (especially the XOR operator), the basic block cipher concept,
and round-based block ciphers such as the Feistel network.
<p><DT><B>Chapter 4 - Basic Concepts in Number Theory and Finite Fields.</B><DD> 
There's lots of important mathematical basics in this chapter, with
the three most important topics being modular arithmetic (and its
properties), Euclid's GCD algorithm (and the use of the extended
algorithm for finding multiplicative inverses), and finite field
operations (interpretation with polynomials and the binary/hexadecimal
notation).
<p><DT><B>Chapter 5 - Advanced Encryption Standard.</B><DD> 
This is the most widely used symmetric cipher, so it is important to
understand. The most important parts are the basic parameters (block
and key sizes), but you should know the basic structure (the 4
building blocks) and have a good feel for efficiency/speed.
<p><DT><B>Chapter 6 - Block Cipher Operation.</B><DD> 
The most important part of this chapter is understanding block cipher
modes. The ones you absolutely must understand very well are ECB, CBC,
and CTR modes, and understanding things like dependencies and error
propagation is important. The importance of randomizing these modes
with appropriate IV or counters is also important.
