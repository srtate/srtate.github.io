    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 5 - Due Monday, April 14</H1>

<P><P><P><I>Note: This homework assignment is worth 50 points.</I>
<OL><LI><p>The beginning of this problem is similar to a problem on your last
homework: Use Table 8.1 on page 234 to pick two random primes (<I>p</I> and
<I>q</I>) in the range <I>1500,...,2000</I>. Compute <I>n=pq</I> and <I>phi(n)</I>,
and .  let's use <I>b</I> to represent <I>phi(n)</I> (i.e., <I>b=phi(n)</I>). Find
the prime factorization of <I>b</I> and then use the equation from Problem
8.12 (page 264) to find <I>phi(b)</I>. Pick a random <I>e</I> that is
relatively prime to <I>b</I>, and use the technique from Problem 5 on your
last homework to compute the multiplicative inverse of <I>e</I> modulo <I>b</I>
-- call this <I>d</I>. Finally, verify that these values work as RSA keys:
Pick two different random messages <I>m<sub>1</sub></I> and <I>m<sub>2</sub></I> in the range
<I>0,...,n-1</I> -- for each one, compute <I>c<sub>i</sub>=m<sub>i</sub><sup>e</sup> mod n</I> and
<I>r<sub>i</sub>=c<sub>i</sub><sup>d</sup> mod n</I>, and if everything works you should have <I>m<sub>i</sub>=r<sub>i</sub></I>.</p>
<LI><p>OAEP, described at the bottom of page 277 in the textbook and
illustrated in Figure 9.10, is a very important technique -- without
it, the RSA encryption function is deterministic and stateless, and so
cannot be IND-CPA secure! However, using OAEP (or any technique that
adds non-determinism) reduces the size of plaintexts that can be
encrypted. Assuming that OAEP is using a 160-bit seed and a hash
function that produces a 160-bit value, how large a plaintext can be
handled using RSA with 2048-bit key? Note that you can't really get
enough information from the brief description in the book to determine
this -- search and find a more precise description of OAEP online
(and make sure you cite any source that you use!).</p>
<LI><p>The "man-in-the-middle attack" for the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
(described starting on page 290) is a serious problem that stems from
the fact that Alice cannot guarantee that the message she sends to Bob
is the same as the message that Bob receives. Consider using a public
web site (like a discussion forum) as follows: Alice and Bob post
their values <I>Y<sub>A</sub></I> and <I>Y<sub>B</sub></I> on this site, and they retrieve the other
side's value from this site. Alice and Bob can also check the web site
(from different hosts if they want to disguise their identity) to see
if the correct value is being provided by the public web site. Does
this solve the problem? Address issues such as how you identify
another user, whether the communication link that Alice and/or Bob
uses is compromised, etc.</p>
