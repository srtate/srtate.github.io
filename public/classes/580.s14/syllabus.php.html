<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Warning: Make sure you have the proper edition 
  -- when you are given homework assignments from the
  book, they refer to problem numbers in <B>this</B> edition!</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><P><B>Other Reading:</B>  
<UL><LI>Required readings: Some topics will require reading of
  supplemental materials, including instructor-written handouts and
  published materials. Hardcopies will be handed out in class, and
  electronic copies will be made available when possible.
<LI>Graduate students will be given copies of current research
  papers to read and critique -- these 
  will also be available on the class web page when possible.
</UL>
<P><P><B>Teaching Methods and Assignments:</B> The primary method of
instruction will be two 75-minute periods per week for lecture and
discussion, with students responsible for completing assigned
readings, assignments, and preparing for exams outside of class.
Assignments will be a mix of written analysis and applied programming
or system experimentation.  Written assignments should be turned in on
paper and may be either neatly handwritten or printed.  Please do not
e-mail written homework solutions unless it is an emergency situation,
and in that case please use a system-independent format such as a text
file or a PDF -- <EM>do not e-mail Word files</EM>.  Programs may be
written in any language that can satisfy the assignment requirements
and that I can run, including C, C++, Java, Python, and Sage (a
Python-based language/system that directly supports the mathematical
structures that are fundamental to cryptography) - check with me in
advance if you want to use another language.  In some cases
programming assignments should also be submitted electronically, in
which case instructions will be given with the assignment.
<P><I>Graduate Students:</I> In addition to the work described above,
graduate students will be given approximately four research papers
during the semester to read and report on with a 1-2 page written
summary and critique.  In addition, graduate students will complete a
project based on current research in a security-related topic of their
own choosing, with the result typically being a 10-15 page survey
paper summarizing research related to that topic.
<P><P><B>Evaluation and Grading:</B> Each assignment will be labeled with the
number of points that it will count, relative to other assignments.
Scores will be combined to produce a final average according to the
following weighting scheme:

<P><B>Exams:</B>
<UL><LI>Midterm: Wednesday, March 5
<LI>Final: Friday, May 2, 7:00pm - 10:00pm    (sorry...)
</UL>
<P><P><B>Academic Integrity:</B>   Students are expected to be familiar
with and abide by the UNCG Academic Integrity Policy, which is online
at 
<A HREF="http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/"><CODE>http://academicintegrity.uncg.edu/</CODE></A>
<P>Assignments in this class are for individual work, unless explicitly
stated otherwise.  General concepts and material covered in the class
may be discussed with other students or in study groups, but specific
assignments should not be discussed and <EM>all submitted work should be
entirely your own</EM>.  It is expected that the class textbook will be
used as a reference, but if any other reference materials are used in
preparing homework solutions they should be clearly cited.  Any
incidents of academic dishonesty will be handled strictly, resulting in
either a zero on the assignment or an F in the class, depending on the
severity of the incident, and incidents will be reported to the
appropriate UNCG office.
<P><P><B>Attendance Policy:</B> Attendance will not be taken in class, and is
voluntary; however, all students are responsible for everything done
or said in class (this can include changes in assignments, due dates,
etc.).  The university allows for a limited number of excused absences
for religious observances -- students who plan to take such an
absence should notify the instructor at least two weeks in advance so
that accommodations can be made (see the late work policy below).
It is the student's responsibility to obtain notes from another
student if they miss class.
<P><B>Laptop/Cellphone Policy:</B>  
This class has a strict "no
non-class related use" rule for laptops -- if you are found
violating this policy, then your in-class laptop privileges will be
taken away.   Cellphones are a distraction for everyone, and should be
turned off during class.  If there is a special situation where you
need to have your phone on for a particular day, please let the
instructor know the situation before class.
<P><P><B>Late Policy and Makeup Exams:</B> 
Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, and may
be turned in up to 7 calendar days late with a 25% late penalty.
Students with planned absences, whether for university events,
religious observance, or other reason, are expected to make
arrangements with the instructor to turn in assignments or take exams
before the scheduled date of the assignment or test.
<EM>No assignment will be accepted more than 7 calendar days after
  the original due date!</EM>
<P>Exam/test dates will be announced at least two weeks in advance, and
may be made up <EM>only</EM> if it was missed due to an extreme
emergency and arrangements are made <EM>before</EM> the exam date.
Exams (including the final) may not be taken early or late due to
personal travel plans.
<P><P><B>ADA Statement:</B> UNCG seeks to comply fully with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Students requesting accommodations based
on a disability must be registered with the Office of Accessibility
Resources and Services located in 215 Elliott University Center: (336)
334-5440 (or <A HREF="http://ods.uncg.edu"><CODE>http://ods.uncg.edu</CODE></A>).
<P><P><B>University Closings:</B>  If university facilities are closed due to flu
outbreak or other emergencies, it does not mean that classes are
canceled. In such an event, please check the class web page and
Blackboard site for information about if and how the class will
proceed. 
<P><P><B>Commercial note-taking services:</B> Selling class notes for
commercial gain or purchasing such class notes in this or any other
course at UNCG is a violation of the University's Copyright Policy and
of the Student Code of Conduct.  Sharing notes for studying purposes,
or borrowing notes to make up for absences, without commercial gain,
are not violations.
