    <H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Assignment 1 - Due Monday, February 3</H1>


<P><P><P><EM>Note: Remember that one of the main goals of this class is to
  develop your skills in reasoning about security, so show your work
  and explain your reasoning on all problems - for homework problems,
  your thought process is as important as the final answer!</EM>
<OL><LI><p>In this question, you should read about the recent security breach at
Target stores, and write a summary taking into account the security
goals and terminology from Chapter 1 of your textbook. For information
on this security breach, you should read at least the following three
articles
-- there's certainly plenty more out there if you want to read more,
but these cover the important technical points:
<UL><LI><p><A HREF="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/">A First Look at the Target Intrusion, Malware</A> -- Krebs on Security</p>
<LI><p><A HREF="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-closer-look-at-the-target-malware-part-ii/">A Closer Look at the Target Malware, Part II</A> -- Krebs on Security<BR></p><LI><p><A HREF="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/12/can-hackers-decrypt-targets-pin-data.html">Can hackers decrypt Target's PIN data?</A> -- by Matthew Green <BR><I>Warning: This one is a little more dense to read, and uses
  some cryptographic terms we have not covered yet. Still, try to read
  it and see what you can get out of it. If the terminology is a big
  enough barrier where you can't get the "big picture," then ask me
  about things that are unclear, and I'll fill in details as needed.</I></p>
</UL>
Your summary should be brief (less than a page), but be careful to use
proper terminology. In particular, what <EM>assets</EM> were compromised
in this <EM>attack</EM>? (Hint: Think broadly: stolen information is
certainly an asset, but so is company infrastructure.) For these
assets, what are <EM>confidentiality</EM>, <EM>integrity</EM>, and
<EM>availability</EM> goals, and were they compromised? Where was a
<EM>vulnerability</EM> used as an <EM>attack vector</EM>? (This is
complex: there were certainly multiple attack vectors, some of which
are not publicly known - just summarize the ones described in the
stories referenced above.)</p>
<LI><p>Textbook, page 56, Problem 2.1.</p>
<LI><p>Following up on textbook Problem 2.1, how many valid keys are
  there in the system described in the textbook problem? If we
  slightly increased the alphabet size to 29 (so operations are
  performed mod 29), what does your discovery from Problem 2.1(c) tell
  you about which values of <I>a</I> are allowed now, and how many valid
  keys are there in this situation?</p>
<LI><p>In some systems, different keys can produce the same
  transformation, so the keyspace seems larger than it actually is.
  Consider the following illustration of
  this: Joe decides to strengthen the affine cipher in the preceding
  question by performing the affine cipher twice with two different
  keys: the plaintext is first transformed using key <I>[a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>]</I>,
  giving intermediate ciphertext <I>C<sub>1</sub></I>, and then <I>C<sub>1</sub></I> is transformed
  using a different key <I>[a<sub>2</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>]</I> to produce the final ciphertext
  <I>C</I>. The full key is then the set of four values <I>a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>,
  b<sub>2</sub></I>, where each <I>[a<sub>i</sub>,b<sub>i</sub>]</I> satisfies the necessary requirements
  for an affine cipher.
<UL><LI>[(a)] How many such keys are there?
<LI>[(b)] How many different transformations are possible, and how
  can a brute force search be performed much faster than the number of
  keys from part (a) would suggest?
</UL></p>
<LI><p>The book describes the one-time pad on pages 47 and 48 using 
  letter-based operations (mod 26), and we are discussing the exclusive-or binary
  version of a one-time pad in class. In this question, each bit of
  the key is randomly chosen, independently of all other key bits, and
  we explore the
  importance of a uniform distribution for key bits.
<UL><LI>[(a)] Consider a system in which each bit of the key is uniformly
  distributed, so has probability 1/2 of being 0 and 1/2 of being
  1. Given a one-byte ciphertext that is hexadecimal <I>A7</I> (binary
  <I>10100111</I>) what is the probability that the plaintext is <I>4F</I>? What is
  the probability that the plaintext is <I>58</I>? Is there any rational reason
  to prefer one of these possible plaintexts over the other?
<LI>[(b)] Consider a system in which the bits of the key are biased:
  each bit is 0 with probability 1/4 and 1 with probability 3/4.
  Given a one-byte ciphertext that is hexadecimal <I>A7</I>
  what is the probability that the plaintext is <I>4F</I>? What is
  the probability that the plaintext is <I>58</I>? Is there any rational reason
  to prefer one of these possible plaintexts over the other?
</UL>
</p>
<LI><p>Consider the Feistel network shown in the book in Figure 3.3
  (page 69). Consider a round function <I>F</I> that satisfies the formula
  <I>F(not(R),not(K))=F(R,K)</I> for all inputs <I>R</I> and <I>K</I>,
  where the <I>not(X)</I> notation indicates the bitwise complement
  of <I>X</I>. In words, if you consider computing <I>F(R,K)</I> and then flip
  all the bits of both <I>R</I> and <I>K</I>, the result stays the same.  This
  seems like a strange property for the round function to satisfy, but
  in fact the DES round function has this property!</p>
<P>Let <I>E(K,P)</I> refer to the full 16-round Feistel cipher in Figure 3.3,
where the round function <I>F</I> satisfies this property. What is
<I>E(not(K),not(P))</I>? Give a clear justification of your
answer -- the justification is more important than the formula for the answer!</p>
