<ol type="1">
<li><p>Consider the language</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ L = \{ \texttt{a}^i\texttt{b}^j\texttt{c}^i\texttt{d}^j \ |\  i,j\geq 0
        \}\ .\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the language of strings consisting of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{a}\)</span>’s followed by <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{b}\)</span>’s followed by <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{c}\)</span>’s followed by <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{d}\)</span>’s in which the number of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{a}\)</span>’s matches the number of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{c}\)</span>’s and the number of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{b}\)</span>’s matches the number of <span class="math inline">\(\texttt{d}\)</span>’s. Use the Pumping lemma for context free languages (Theorem 2.34 on page 125) to show that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is not a context-free language:</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Note: This question is just for Dr. Tate’s section (section 2). Dr. Tong will provide an alternative question for her section.</strong> Consider the following CFG:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \begin{array}{l}
S \rightarrow T\dashv \\
T \rightarrow \texttt{(}T\texttt{)}\ |\ TT\ |\ \varepsilon\\
\end{array} \]</span></p>
<p>This CFG generates exactly the same language as the CFG in Example 2.55 of the textbook: the set of all strings of properly nested parentheses. Example 2.55 showed that grammar in that example was a DCFG. For this problem, show that the grammar above is <em>not</em> a DCFG. To do this, draw the full DFA <span class="math inline">\(DK\)</span> and show precisely where it fails the DK-test conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider Turing machine <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> from Example 3.9 (page 173). Give the sequence of configurations that <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> enters when started with each of the following input strings (note that this is similar to Exercise 3.2 in the book, just with different inputs — see the provided solution to 3.2a for guidance):</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>01</p></li>
<li><p>0#0</p></li>
<li><p>0#1#0</p></li>
<li><p>01#00</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>(<strong>Hint:</strong> <em>For this problem and the next one, start by fully understanding how the Turing machine in Example 3.9 works!</em>) Consider the language</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ L = \{ \texttt{a}^n\texttt{b}^n\texttt{c}^n\ |\ n\geq 0\} \]</span></p>
<p>This was the first language that the textbook proved is not context free using the pumping lemma, in Example 2.36 on page 128. Since <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is not context free, it can’t be recognized by any PDA. However, you can create a TM to recognize <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, which is what you’ll do for this problem.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Give an implementation-level description of a Turing machine that decides language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (note: “implementation-level” means written-out steps, like at the beginning of Example 3.7, Example 3.11, or in the textbook’s provided solution to Exercise 3.8a).</p></li>
<li><p>Draw out a full Turing machine description for a machine that decides language <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>In some situations, we want to run multiple Turing machines, say <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> on the same input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. However, what if <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> destroys the original input (like machine <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> in Example 3.9). How do you run <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> on the original input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> has been destroyed by running <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span>? This causes a problem for the (incorrect!) solution for Exercise 3.15a given in the textbook.</p>
<p>Let’s correct this problem by creating a TM that makes a copy of input <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> first, so <span class="math inline">\(M_1\)</span> can work on the copy and leave the original input intact. In particular, we want to create a TM that starts with string <span class="math inline">\(w\in\{\texttt{0},\texttt{1}\}^*\)</span> on its tape, and when it finishes running has <span class="math inline">\(w\texttt{@}w\)</span> on its tape with the tape head positioned before the first character in the copy of <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\texttt{@}\)</span> is just a new tape symbol).</p>
<p>Design a TM that does this. Start by sketching out how it works with an implementation-level description of the steps, and then draw out the full TM. Note that this is a “subroutine” that is used as part of a larger machine, so there are no “accept” or “reject” states – simply a “finished” state.</p></li>
