<P><B>TEACHING</B>
<UL><LI>Experience teaching a wide range of courses, including
  introductory undergraduate courses, assembly language, data
  structures, file structures, cryptography, computer security and
  secure electronic commerce courses (both undergraduate and
  graduate), mathematics for computer science, undergraduate and
  graduate algorithms, research-oriented special topics classes
  (including trusted computing and software security), and several
  advanced graduate seminars (topics: data compression, on-line
  algorithms, randomized algorithms, Java and network security, and
  cryptography and security).
<LI>Worked with other faculty to expand computer security courses at
  UNC Greensboro from a single course to a three-course series (with
  additional courses as "special topics" classes).
<LI>Created and maintained a five-module interactive Python
  tutorial, using Runestone Interactive tools; used in multiple UNCG
  classes (CSC 100, CSC 101, CSC 110, and CSC 120), and in UNCG's
  Master's in Informatics and Analytics "Python programming
  bootcamp" (2017 - present)
<LI>Re-implemented a "fractal explorer" in JavaScript, based on an
  earlier Java applet from Ron Eglash at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
  (RPI). This was used to teach recursive constructions in a
  culturally-situated context, and has been used in my UNCG CSC 100
  class, as well as by RPI and others.
<LI>Created and led a Living-Learning Community for freshman
  computer science majors, 2014-2015.
<LI>Organizing committee and computer
  science lead, AToMS Living-Learning Community, a residential
  cohort-based learning community for computer science, chemistry,
  physics, and mathematics freshmen. 2012-2014.
<LI>Participated in the UNCG Veteran and Military Affiliate Education
  Institute, June 2013.
<LI>Member of the UNCG delegation to an AAC&amp;U Summer Institute on
  Integrated Learning, Burlington, VT, July 2012.
<LI>Designed a custom version of the UC Berkeley "Beauty and Joy of
  Computing" class for UNC Greensboro (offered as CSC 100). While
  following the UC Berkeley outline, our
  version has a full set of locally-developed lectures and extensive
  lab exercises. 
  Worked with teachers at a local high school (Weaver Academy) to
  offer this course at the high school as well. Designed around the
  College Board's "CS Principles" course/exam, we now offer credit
  for this class to high school students who make a 3 or better on the
  AP CS Principles exam. Offered for the first time Fall 2012.
<LI>Designed an innovative class (CSC 110: Computational Problem
  Solving), taking a creative approach to teaching mathematics
  concepts and problem-solving skills as part of the UNC Greensboro
  general education curriculum, 2009.
<LI>Organized and supervised a group of 6 directed study students
  who performed a formal security audit of the Department of Computer
  Science systems and network (Fall 2005).
<LI>Organized and coached a team of 8 students (including 2 from the
  Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences) for
  participation in the <EM>1st Texas Collegiate Cyber Defense
  Contest</EM>, San Antonio, April 2005 (travel funding from Microsoft).
<LI>Designed and established a multi-course sequence in computer
  security at both undergraduate and graduate levels at the University
  of North Texas.  Applied for and
  received two federal certifications, showing a
  mapping of our computer security courses to two the Committee for
  National Security Systems (CNSS) training standards 4011 (for
  Information Security Professionals) and 4013 (for Secure System
  Administration).
<LI>Participated in teaching workshops on secure electronic commerce
  and network security (Washington D.C., March 2003;  Tulsa, OK, July
  2003).
<LI>Organized and supervised a group of three graduate students in
  the <EM>Honeynet Reverse Engineering Challenge</EM>, placing second in
  this international competition (May-June 2002).
</UL>
<P><B>Individual Student Mentoring</B>
<UL><LI>Supervised 13 master's students at UNCG (4 thesis; 9 project)
<LI>Mentored approximately 30 undergraduate students in Senior
  Project work, 2007-2018.
<LI>Mentored three students in UNCG Honors Contract courses and projects
<LI>Five graduated Ph.D. students at UNT (Brent Chapin, 2001; Ke Xu, 2004;
  He Ge, 2006; Vandana Gunupudi, 2007; Ping Yu, 2008).
<LI>Served or currently serving on 18 Ph.D. committees and 7
Master's committee at UNT (other than my own students).
<LI>External reviewer and Ph.D. committee member for a student
(Elliott Landowne) at the City University of New York.
<LI>Supervised over a dozen students (both at undergraduate and
  graduate levels) in directed study and independent projects.
