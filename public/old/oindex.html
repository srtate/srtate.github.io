		    </blockquote>
		    <p>I have been programming and working with computers since the 1970's, and my path has brought me full-circle, from practice to theory and back to practice again. I started out loving the creativity of programming and the ability to create systems that did what I designed them to do. When I went to college and started studying computer science, I discovered that there are some deep and non-obvious aspects to computing, and those captured my attention &ndash; after all, just programming is easy, right? Through graduate school and into my career in academia, I was largely a theoretical computer scientist, looking at the underlying logic and issues that affect how computing works, proving theorems more and more, and writing programs less and less. I worked a lot in the mathematics of cryptography, proposing and proving properties about mathematical functions that could do very cool and esoteric things. In the back of my mind, I wanted these inventions to have practical impact, but I was too busy doing cool math to worry too much about that &mdash; surely someone else would do the "easy" job of programming, right?</p>
		    <p>Recently, however, some of the big and very visible failures in security software have brought me back to programming &ndash; no, programming is <em>not</em> easy, particularly when creating the kind of highly complex software that we depend on to keep us secure and protect our privacy. Since 2015, I have been on a mission to make software, and security software in particular, better. I teach students at all levels how to reason about the correctness and quality of their code (and sometimes make them frustrated because I love to find ways to make their programs misbehave). In my research, I look for new automated techniques for both finding bugs in code and for producing high-assurance software. Whether you are a student just starting out, an advanced student looking for research projects, or an established researcher looking for collaboration, I invite you to join me on this mission. Let's make software more secure!</p>
<p>Like almost all university faculty, my work is categorized into the three standard faculty duties: teaching, research, and service. More about each is below.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">I'm a true believer in higher education &ndash; it's not just a job for me, but a calling to make universities the strongest possible centers of knowledge and discovery. Universities improve the world, on a large scale through the discoveries we make, and on an individual scale through the students who we help grow. I served as Department Head for UNCG's Department of Computer Science from its founding in 2007 until 2019, where I  led the department from its creation to one of the most in-demand and thriving departments at UNCG, serving over 500 computer science majors. We have had remarkable successes as a department, and this has been a rewarding chapter in my career. I am now returning to spending more time focused on computer science research and student development, and am always looking for ways to make the university stronger.</p>

<hr class="primary">
<p>
I am a Professor in the <a href="http://compsci.uncg.edu/">Department of
       Computer Science</a> at
       the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/">University of North Carolina
       at Greensboro</a>. I came to UNCG in 2007 to start the
       Department of Computer Science, as the computer science
       programs (bachelor's and master's) were splitting from the
       former Department of Mathematical Sciences, and I served as
       Department Head until 2019. I have bachelor's degrees in
       Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mathematics from
       Vanderbilt University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science
       from <a href="http://www.duke.edu/">Duke University</a> in
       1991, followed by a 2 year postdoc working on data compression
       algorithms for <a href="http://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a>.
</p>
		    <p>Before joining UNCG, I was on the faculty at <a href="http://www.unt.edu/">The University of North Texas</a> for 14 years, in what was originally the Department of Computer Science and later became the <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>. At UNT I created and directed the <a href="http://cics.unt.edu/">Center for Information and Computer Security</a>, which won recognition by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. At UNT I also served as Director of Graduate Studies from 1996 to 2001, managing the department's masters and doctoral programs.  In addition to my current work in software security, I have worked and published in several other areas, including cryptography, computer security, algebraic algorithms, circuit complexity, online algorithms, and data compression, with papers appearing in many leading conferences and journals.</p>
<p>My full professional background is in my <a href="vita.php.html">vita</a>, which includes a list of major awards and accomplishments.</p>
