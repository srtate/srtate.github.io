<h2>Research Information</h2>

<p> My current research is in the area of computer security, with
recent projects in both hardware-assisted security and mobile agent
security.  Recently I have begun looking at issues in software
security, and in particular looking at secure and robust
implementations for cryptographic and security-oriented software
&ndash; the goal of this work is to respond to the rash of security vulnerabilities
we have seen lately (such as <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a>,
the Apple <a
href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/02/22/applebug.html">"goto
fail" bug</a>, and the <a
href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/03/critical-crypto-bug-leaves-linux-hundreds-of-apps-open-to-eavesdropping/">GnuTLS
vulnerabilites</a>) by developing tools and techniques for detecting
and eradicating these vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Results from previous research can be found in <a
href="publications.php.html">published papers</a> and in various
freely-available software packages. Our work in in agent security has
resulted in in the freely-available SAgent agent security
framework (for the JADE agent platform), and work on
hardware-based security has produced a <a
href="http://span.uncg.edu/tpmsim">Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
simulator</a> that accurately reflects not only the functionality but
also the performance of TPM v1.1 and v1.2 hardware from a variety of
manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>My research has been supported by various sources, including the National Science Foundation, the Texas Advanced Research Program, NASA, and equipment donations from industry.
</p>
<p> Most recent research and education projects have been funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>. My most recent <a href="http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0915735">funded research project</a> is in models for trusted computing.  I also have an active education-focused <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1323381">NSF-funded project</a> that is focused on developing active-learning activities (using tablets or other devices) in computer science lectures.</p>


<h3>Prior Work</h3>
<p>
In the past, my main research was in algorithm and data structure design and analysis, as well as a strong interest in data compression. I did work in on-line and dynamic algorithms, and I have also done work in parallel algorithms/circuit theory, robotics, and algorithms for molecular dynamics. Several of my papers are available electronically, with links from my <a href="publications.php.html">publication list</a>.
