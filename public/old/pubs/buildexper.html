S.R. Tate and B. Yuan. "On the Efficiency of Building Large

<b>Abstract:</b><br/>
<p>
  Building software from source code requires a build environment that
  meets certain requirements, such as the presence of specific
  compilers, libraries, or other tools. Unfortunately, requirements
  for different packages can conflict with each other, so it is often
  impossible to use a single build environment when building a large
  collection of software. This paper develops techniques to minimize
  the number of distinct build environments required, and measures the
  practical impact of our techniques on build time.  In particular, we
  introduce the notion of a "conflict graph," and prove that the
  problem of minimizing the number of build environments is equivalent
  to the graph coloring problem on this graph. We explore several
  heuristic techniques to compute conflict graph colorings, finding
  solutions that result in surprisingly small sets of build
  environments. Using Ubuntu 20.04 as our primary experimental
  dataset, we computed just 4 different environments that were
  sufficient for building the "Top 500" most popular source
  packages, and 11 build environments were sufficient for building all
  30,646 source packages included in Ubuntu 20.04. Finally, we
  experimentally evaluate the benefit of these environments by
  comparing the work required for building the "Top 500" with our
  environments to the work required using the traditional minimal
  environment build. We saw that the total work required for
  building these packages dropped from 139h36m (139 hours and 36
  minutes) to 54h18m, a 61% reduction.
